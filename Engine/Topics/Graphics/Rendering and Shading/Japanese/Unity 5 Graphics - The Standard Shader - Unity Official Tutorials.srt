1
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:06,451
The Standard Shader is a powerful and versatile shader.

2
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,520
This single physically-based shader

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:11,520
can be used to make such a wide variety

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,520
of materials it's easily

5
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:15,520
possible that this one shader can make

6
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:18,121
every material in a given project.

7
00:00:19,812 --> 00:00:24,026
The standard is used to create Unity's default material.

8
00:00:24,026 --> 00:00:26,026
So all mesh rendered using

9
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:29,768
the default material will be using the standard shader.

10
00:00:33,412 --> 00:00:36,190
All new materials that are created

11
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:38,930
will use the standard shader as well.

12
00:00:40,121 --> 00:00:42,611
To change the shader used by a material

13
00:00:42,611 --> 00:00:45,236
select the Shader menu on the material.

14
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:49,291
Select Standard to use the standard shader.

15
00:00:49,971 --> 00:00:51,971
It is worth noting the Unity

16
00:00:51,971 --> 00:00:53,971
has shaders available for both

17
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:56,779
popular approaches to physically-based rendering.

18
00:00:57,736 --> 00:00:59,443
Metallic, as default,

19
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:01,613
and specular.

20
00:01:01,613 --> 00:01:03,251
To choose the standard shader

21
00:01:03,251 --> 00:01:05,167
using the specular approach

22
00:01:05,167 --> 00:01:07,601
select Standard (Specular Setup).

23
00:01:08,475 --> 00:01:10,475
Otherwise use Standard

24
00:01:10,475 --> 00:01:12,475
for the metallic approach.

25
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:16,750
It is important to understand that the

26
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:19,337
metallic approach to physically-based shading

27
00:01:19,337 --> 00:01:21,337
is not only for materials which are

28
00:01:21,337 --> 00:01:23,100
supposed to look metallic.

29
00:01:23,696 --> 00:01:25,696
This mode is known as metallic

30
00:01:25,696 --> 00:01:27,696
because this approach is based on

31
00:01:27,696 --> 00:01:30,761
defining how metallic or non-metallic

32
00:01:30,761 --> 00:01:32,761
that material's surface is.

33
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:35,703
This is opposed to the specular approach

34
00:01:35,703 --> 00:01:37,451
which defines how specular, 

35
00:01:37,451 --> 00:01:39,451
or non-specular that surface is.

36
00:01:40,505 --> 00:01:42,505
Both approaches are valid ways to

37
00:01:42,505 --> 00:01:44,505
describe a physically-based material.

38
00:01:47,459 --> 00:01:49,459
This physically-based material is

39
00:01:49,459 --> 00:01:51,362
still a standard Unity material

40
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:53,695
and this material is associated

41
00:01:53,695 --> 00:01:56,302
with a renderer in the same way as usual.

42
00:02:00,014 --> 00:02:02,990
There are three sections to the standard shader.

43
00:02:03,601 --> 00:02:05,601
Rendering Mode.

44
00:02:05,601 --> 00:02:07,601
Main Maps

45
00:02:07,601 --> 00:02:09,601
and Secondary Maps.

46
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:14,685
The standard shader has four rendering modes.

47
00:02:14,685 --> 00:02:17,996
Opaque, Cutout, Fade and Transparent.

48
00:02:19,038 --> 00:02:22,598
Most materials are opaque, or solid materials.

49
00:02:23,167 --> 00:02:25,558
Opaque is the default render mode.

50
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:29,225
For transparent materials, such as glass,

51
00:02:29,225 --> 00:02:31,225
choose Transparent.

52
00:02:31,656 --> 00:02:33,656
In transparent rendering mode

53
00:02:34,142 --> 00:02:36,819
the alpha channel on the diffuse colour property

54
00:02:36,819 --> 00:02:39,930
is used to control the level of transparency.

55
00:02:41,569 --> 00:02:43,918
With rendering mode cutout

56
00:02:43,918 --> 00:02:45,918
the alpha channel of the diffuse image

57
00:02:45,918 --> 00:02:49,022
is used to mask out parts of the texture.

58
00:02:49,689 --> 00:02:53,240
If the alpha channel has a gradient value to the mask

59
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,240
the alpha cutoff slider can be used

60
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,240
to adjust the shape of the cutout.

61
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:00,837
based on the strength of the mask in the alpha channel.

62
00:03:02,546 --> 00:03:04,546
Rendering mode fade is similar

63
00:03:04,546 --> 00:03:06,546
to rendering mode transparent.

64
00:03:07,509 --> 00:03:09,509
Fade is intended for fading out

65
00:03:09,509 --> 00:03:11,509
game objects on screen.

66
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:14,192
With rendering mode transparent

67
00:03:14,192 --> 00:03:16,750
a transparent material will preserve it's

68
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:20,681
reflectivity regardless of it's alpha value.

69
00:03:20,681 --> 00:03:22,681
Fade however will fade all

70
00:03:22,681 --> 00:03:24,681
relevant aspects of the material

71
00:03:24,681 --> 00:03:28,018
so the faded material is completely invisible.

72
00:03:30,347 --> 00:03:33,736
The main map section defines the look of the material.

73
00:03:34,361 --> 00:03:37,301
Before going in to the details of each property

74
00:03:37,301 --> 00:03:40,578
there are a few subjects that are worth covering first.

75
00:03:41,314 --> 00:03:43,131
Optimisation.

76
00:03:43,131 --> 00:03:46,071
The standard shader is highly optimised.

77
00:03:46,613 --> 00:03:48,613
When the standard shader is built

78
00:03:48,613 --> 00:03:50,613
two important things happen.

79
00:03:51,113 --> 00:03:54,698
All properties that are not being used are discarded.

80
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,240
The build target is checked

81
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,907
and the shader is optimised for that device.

82
00:04:00,559 --> 00:04:03,653
Because of this there is no need to populate every

83
00:04:03,653 --> 00:04:06,073
property with a map or values.

84
00:04:07,681 --> 00:04:09,681
And there is no need to worry about wasted

85
00:04:09,681 --> 00:04:12,357
resources due to unused properties.

86
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,750
Physically-based shading.

87
00:04:18,451 --> 00:04:20,451
Physically-based shading tries to define

88
00:04:20,451 --> 00:04:23,952
certain physical aspects of a material's surface.

89
00:04:23,952 --> 00:04:25,952
Including it's diffuse colour,

90
00:04:25,952 --> 00:04:27,952
specular refection and other properties

91
00:04:27,952 --> 00:04:30,355
so the material behaves correctly

92
00:04:30,355 --> 00:04:33,279
and believably in all lighting environments.

93
00:04:33,938 --> 00:04:36,325
The response of the scene lighting to the material

94
00:04:36,325 --> 00:04:38,325
created with a physically based shader

95
00:04:38,325 --> 00:04:41,192
mimics light in the real physical world.

96
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:43,839
This means that even though there is

97
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:45,839
full control over the values on

98
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:48,613
all of the properties in the standard shader

99
00:04:48,613 --> 00:04:50,613
there are certain ranges of values that

100
00:04:50,613 --> 00:04:53,359
work best for certain types of materials.

101
00:04:54,057 --> 00:04:57,736
This is particularly true of the metallic and specular values

102
00:04:57,736 --> 00:05:00,543
depending up which approach is being used

103
00:05:01,273 --> 00:05:03,723
Taking specular colour for example,

104
00:05:03,723 --> 00:05:06,199
when analysing real-world materials

105
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:08,199
most materials have a specular range

106
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:10,199
that is a very dark grey.

107
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:15,416
Metals created with a specular workflow are one of the few exceptions,

108
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:18,095
they have very bright specular values.

109
00:05:19,043 --> 00:05:22,066
As well, no material, even the most dull,

110
00:05:22,066 --> 00:05:24,066
has no specularity at all.

111
00:05:24,997 --> 00:05:26,997
This means to have a physically based

112
00:05:26,997 --> 00:05:28,997
material behave correctly

113
00:05:28,997 --> 00:05:30,997
some attention needs to be paid in using

114
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:34,316
the correct physical values for some key properties,

115
00:05:34,316 --> 00:05:37,149
especially the specular or metallic properties

116
00:05:37,149 --> 00:05:39,149
depending upon the approach being used.

117
00:05:40,224 --> 00:05:42,863
For more information on physical-based shading,

118
00:05:42,863 --> 00:05:45,553
material charts and sample materials

119
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:47,553
please see the information linked below.

120
00:05:48,512 --> 00:05:50,512
There is no need to panic however.

121
00:05:50,512 --> 00:05:53,002
Items with materials from previous versions of Unity

122
00:05:53,002 --> 00:05:55,284
will work well out of the box.

123
00:05:55,894 --> 00:05:58,214
Upgrading from a legacy diffuse shader

124
00:05:58,214 --> 00:06:01,265
to the standard shader should display little or no difference.

125
00:06:03,307 --> 00:06:05,738
In the main map section each of these properties

126
00:06:05,738 --> 00:06:08,318
control one aspect of the final material.

127
00:06:09,127 --> 00:06:11,942
Each property can be defined by a texture map.

128
00:06:13,328 --> 00:06:15,096
With the metallic approach,

129
00:06:15,096 --> 00:06:18,163
for the albido, metallic and emission properties

130
00:06:18,163 --> 00:06:20,163
the texture is optional.

131
00:06:20,661 --> 00:06:22,904
The albido and emission properties

132
00:06:22,904 --> 00:06:25,531
can simply use a colour value instead of a texture.

133
00:06:26,508 --> 00:06:28,416
The colour value is not available on

134
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:30,416
the emission property until the emissive

135
00:06:30,416 --> 00:06:32,416
scale is larger than 0.

136
00:06:34,775 --> 00:06:36,775
The metallic property can use a slider

137
00:06:36,775 --> 00:06:38,775
instead of a texture.

138
00:06:42,516 --> 00:06:44,516
The albido property uses a

139
00:06:44,516 --> 00:06:46,516
combination of an optional texture.

140
00:06:48,543 --> 00:06:51,598
And a colour value to define the base look of the material.

141
00:06:52,685 --> 00:06:55,682
The colour value will tint the texture.

142
00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:00,535
Where pure white leaves the main texture unaffected,

143
00:07:01,552 --> 00:07:03,552
if there is no texture being used

144
00:07:03,552 --> 00:07:06,792
the tint colour will be the base colour for the material

145
00:07:09,884 --> 00:07:11,884
The metallic property can be defined

146
00:07:11,884 --> 00:07:13,884
by either a texture

147
00:07:15,248 --> 00:07:18,303
or a value from 0 to 1

148
00:07:18,303 --> 00:07:20,303
set by the slider.

149
00:07:20,303 --> 00:07:23,506
This defines the metalness of the material surface.

150
00:07:24,538 --> 00:07:27,332
Metalness works very closely with smoothness.

151
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:30,548
The smoothness property is used to

152
00:07:30,548 --> 00:07:32,061
control the smoothness,

153
00:07:32,061 --> 00:07:35,453
or micro-surface detail, of the material.

154
00:07:35,453 --> 00:07:38,453
It is also a value between 0 and 1.

155
00:07:41,028 --> 00:07:43,028
The less smooth the surface is,

156
00:07:43,028 --> 00:07:44,824
the more diffuse the reflections will be.

157
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,204
The more smooth, the sharper the reflections.

158
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:54,650
The metallic property can use a texture

159
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:57,426
to define the material's metalness.

160
00:07:58,071 --> 00:08:00,071
This texture can be a simple shade of grey

161
00:08:00,071 --> 00:08:03,163
used to define the metalness from black,

162
00:08:03,163 --> 00:08:04,517
or non-metallic,

163
00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:06,517
to white, completely metallic.

164
00:08:07,217 --> 00:08:10,339
However, the advantage of using a texture

165
00:08:10,339 --> 00:08:12,686
to define the metalness of a material

166
00:08:12,686 --> 00:08:14,686
is to vary the metalness value

167
00:08:14,686 --> 00:08:16,686
across the surface of the material.

168
00:08:17,589 --> 00:08:20,654
An additional advantage is this texture's alpha channel.

169
00:08:21,524 --> 00:08:23,524
This alpha channel can be used to define

170
00:08:23,524 --> 00:08:25,524
a smoothness map.

171
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:29,791
Many materials are far more complex

172
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:31,791
than a single uniform surface.

173
00:08:32,657 --> 00:08:34,657
Take this leather case for example.

174
00:08:35,486 --> 00:08:37,486
With a single value for metalness and a

175
00:08:37,486 --> 00:08:39,131
single value for smoothness

176
00:08:39,615 --> 00:08:41,615
the case looks good.

177
00:08:41,615 --> 00:08:43,138
But it could look better.

178
00:08:43,891 --> 00:08:45,891
Use a metalness and smoothness map

179
00:08:45,891 --> 00:08:47,891
to describe the properties.

180
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:51,660
And it looks much better.

181
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,660
Note how the straps are far more glossy

182
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:55,660
than the main body of the case.

183
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,660
Giving them a feel of polished leather.

184
00:08:58,969 --> 00:09:00,969
It is worth noting that when using a texture

185
00:09:00,969 --> 00:09:02,969
to define the metalness

186
00:09:02,969 --> 00:09:04,969
the smoothness value must also be

187
00:09:04,969 --> 00:09:06,969
defined by that texture's alpha channel.

188
00:09:07,983 --> 00:09:09,983
It is also worth noting that the metalness

189
00:09:09,983 --> 00:09:11,983
value is stored only in the red

190
00:09:11,983 --> 00:09:15,013
channel of the metalness map's RGB values.

191
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:17,990
The green and blue channels are ignored.

192
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:21,923
It is often easier however to visualise

193
00:09:21,923 --> 00:09:23,923
the metalness values of a texture

194
00:09:23,923 --> 00:09:26,709
if all three colour channels share the same map,

195
00:09:26,709 --> 00:09:29,573
so the texture appears as a greyscale image.

196
00:09:30,716 --> 00:09:33,440
When using the standard shader with the specular setup

197
00:09:35,615 --> 00:09:37,615
the metallic property is replaced with

198
00:09:37,615 --> 00:09:39,173
the specular property.

199
00:09:39,891 --> 00:09:41,891
The specular approach also uses

200
00:09:41,891 --> 00:09:44,775
a smoothness property, which behaves essentially

201
00:09:44,775 --> 00:09:47,546
in the same way as with the metalness approach.

202
00:09:50,956 --> 00:09:53,585
The specualar property can either be a texture

203
00:09:55,278 --> 00:09:56,728
or a colour value

204
00:09:57,499 --> 00:09:59,499
and defines the specular reflectivity

205
00:09:59,499 --> 00:10:01,628
of the material's surface.

206
00:10:01,628 --> 00:10:04,527
The specular value can have some colour in it

207
00:10:04,527 --> 00:10:06,527
but looking at real world values

208
00:10:06,527 --> 00:10:08,527
with the exception of some metals

209
00:10:08,527 --> 00:10:11,449
this is usually a grey and often very dark.

210
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:15,518
Specular maps are usually a dark grey as well.

211
00:10:17,545 --> 00:10:20,332
When a specular texture map is not being used

212
00:10:20,332 --> 00:10:22,332
the overall surface smoothness can be

213
00:10:22,332 --> 00:10:24,332
set with the slider.

214
00:10:26,765 --> 00:10:28,765
This is easier to see when the albido

215
00:10:28,765 --> 00:10:30,765
texture is removed.

216
00:10:31,502 --> 00:10:33,502
The ball looks like polished porcelain.

217
00:10:34,737 --> 00:10:38,692
For a more true mirror, the specular from dark grey,

218
00:10:38,692 --> 00:10:40,692
which makes the ball look like porcelain

219
00:10:40,692 --> 00:10:43,547
in to the range of metals and it will now

220
00:10:43,547 --> 00:10:45,547
reflect the sky and surroundings.

221
00:10:46,487 --> 00:10:49,357
The smoother the surface, the more it is mirror-like.

222
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:53,077
The rougher the surface the more diffuse,

223
00:10:53,077 --> 00:10:55,077
or scattered the reflections are.

224
00:10:56,588 --> 00:10:58,938
The normal map property is an optional property

225
00:10:58,938 --> 00:11:01,787
used to define the apparent bumpiness of the surface.

226
00:11:02,893 --> 00:11:04,893
When a normal map is applied

227
00:11:05,649 --> 00:11:07,649
the strength of the normal map can be controlled

228
00:11:07,649 --> 00:11:09,927
by adjusting the normal map value.

229
00:11:11,033 --> 00:11:13,033
As well as positive numbers, this value

230
00:11:13,033 --> 00:11:14,758
can be a negative number

231
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:16,455
or 0.

232
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:20,040
The height map property is an optional

233
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,040
property used to define the apparent

234
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,040
height of the surface.

235
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,040
When a height map is applied

236
00:11:26,667 --> 00:11:28,667
the strength of the height map can be controlled

237
00:11:28,667 --> 00:11:30,667
by adjusting the height map value.

238
00:11:32,842 --> 00:11:34,842
The occlusion property uses a

239
00:11:34,842 --> 00:11:36,842
texture map to define the amount of

240
00:11:36,842 --> 00:11:39,509
ambient occlusion that is applied to the material.

241
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:42,799
This is used to help darken

242
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:45,095
hidden or recessed areas on the texture.

243
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,200
The ambient occlusion map also

244
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,200
prevents specular and reflections in

245
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,676
these occluded areas, given the material

246
00:11:52,676 --> 00:11:54,676
a more realistic look.

247
00:11:56,058 --> 00:11:58,690
The emission property controls whether or not

248
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:00,690
the material's surface will emit light.

249
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:03,630
The material's emission value can contribute

250
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:05,630
to the scene's global illumination.

251
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:08,791
The strength of the emission can be controlled

252
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:10,791
by the emission value.

253
00:12:11,215 --> 00:12:14,235
The shape of the emission can be controlled with an emission map.

254
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:17,359
The map can be a simple black and white map.

255
00:12:23,699 --> 00:12:26,447
bBut this texture can also be a colour map.

256
00:12:32,529 --> 00:12:34,529
When there is a value for emission

257
00:12:34,529 --> 00:12:36,529
the contribution of the emissive light

258
00:12:36,529 --> 00:12:39,262
can be assigned to either the baked light maps

259
00:12:40,607 --> 00:12:42,607
or to the real time light maps.

260
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:48,930
The detail mask property is an optional mask element

261
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:50,930
to control the secondary maps.

262
00:12:52,054 --> 00:12:54,708
Tiling and offset control the position of the map.

263
00:12:55,961 --> 00:12:57,961
The secondary maps are used to define

264
00:12:57,961 --> 00:12:59,961
additional surface detail.

265
00:12:59,961 --> 00:13:03,608
This additional detail, sometimes referred to as micro detail,

266
00:13:03,608 --> 00:13:05,608
is added on top of the surface defined

267
00:13:05,608 --> 00:13:07,111
by the main maps.

268
00:13:07,848 --> 00:13:09,848
This helps to add extra detail and

269
00:13:09,848 --> 00:13:12,657
variation to a material, which is overlaid

270
00:13:12,657 --> 00:13:15,460
on top of the main maps defining that material.

271
00:13:16,187 --> 00:13:19,217
Because detail maps can be tiled across meshes

272
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:22,693
they can add incredibly high levels of surface detail.
