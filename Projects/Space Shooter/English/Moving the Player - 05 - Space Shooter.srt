1
00:00:01,616 --> 00:00:04,123
Now that we have our environment fully setup

2
00:00:04,123 --> 00:00:07,410
let's get the player ship moving under our control.

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:10,383
To do this we need to write some very simply code.

4
00:00:10,383 --> 00:00:12,960
We will be writing in C#, which is one of the

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,562
3 scripting languages supported by Unity.

6
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:18,220
To stay organised we need somewhere in our

7
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:20,220
project to store our new scripts.

8
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,720
Let's add a new folder to the root level

9
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,886
of our Assets folder.

10
00:00:24,886 --> 00:00:27,221
It's worth noting that this folder could be placed

11
00:00:27,221 --> 00:00:29,841
anywhere within our Assets folder to work

12
00:00:29,841 --> 00:00:31,841
but for clarity it would seem that the root

13
00:00:31,841 --> 00:00:33,841
level is the best location for such

14
00:00:33,841 --> 00:00:35,491
an important folder.

15
00:00:35,491 --> 00:00:37,491
Select Assets to make sure that we

16
00:00:37,491 --> 00:00:39,657
build this folder on the root level

17
00:00:39,657 --> 00:00:41,272
otherwise we will have to move it after

18
00:00:41,272 --> 00:00:42,981
we have created it.

19
00:00:43,688 --> 00:00:46,106
Use the Create menu in the Project view

20
00:00:46,106 --> 00:00:48,106
and select Folder.

21
00:00:49,034 --> 00:00:51,826
This will create a new folder in Assets.

22
00:00:52,326 --> 00:00:54,326
This new folder will automatically make

23
00:00:54,326 --> 00:00:55,983
itself ready to edit.

24
00:00:55,983 --> 00:00:58,511
Let's change the name to Scripts,

25
00:00:58,953 --> 00:01:00,953
and hit Enter or Return to accept

26
00:01:00,953 --> 00:01:02,953
the change of the name.

27
00:01:03,923 --> 00:01:05,923
Now let's create and add a new script

28
00:01:05,923 --> 00:01:07,853
to our player ship.

29
00:01:07,853 --> 00:01:09,853
I'm going to quickly reduce the view of these

30
00:01:09,853 --> 00:01:11,853
referenced materials shown at the bottom of

31
00:01:11,853 --> 00:01:13,701
the player game object by clicking on

32
00:01:13,701 --> 00:01:15,564
the header bars.

33
00:01:15,564 --> 00:01:17,564
This will make it easier to view and access

34
00:01:17,564 --> 00:01:20,396
the Add Component button without scrolling.

35
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:23,855
Next let's click on Add Component

36
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:26,584
and select New Script.

37
00:01:26,974 --> 00:01:29,558
This will allow us to create and add a new script

38
00:01:29,558 --> 00:01:32,169
directly on to our player game object.

39
00:01:33,011 --> 00:01:35,742
Now let's set the name of the script to

40
00:01:35,742 --> 00:01:37,742
PlayerController.

41
00:01:37,742 --> 00:01:39,742
I feel it's best that we follow the convention of

42
00:01:39,742 --> 00:01:42,251
capitalisation shown here, with a capital

43
00:01:42,251 --> 00:01:44,502
P and a capital C.

44
00:01:44,502 --> 00:01:47,311
Script names should start with a capital letter

45
00:01:47,311 --> 00:01:49,311
and the capitalisation of the name with the

46
00:01:49,311 --> 00:01:52,234
capital C makes the name easier to read.

47
00:01:52,734 --> 00:01:54,734
Once we have chosen a name we can click on

48
00:01:54,734 --> 00:01:57,440
Create and Add, or we can simply hit Return

49
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,879
or Enter to create and add this script.

50
00:02:01,335 --> 00:02:03,335
When we create a script in this manner the script

51
00:02:03,335 --> 00:02:06,470
will be created on the root level of our project.

52
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:08,470
We need to drag and drop it on to the Scripts folder

53
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:10,470
to file it away properly.

54
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:13,891
Now open the scripts folder to view the script.

55
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:17,026
Let's open the script for editing.

56
00:02:17,026 --> 00:02:19,569
We can do this in a number of ways.

57
00:02:19,569 --> 00:02:21,569
1 way is to select the script

58
00:02:21,569 --> 00:02:23,569
and in the Inspector choose Open.

59
00:02:24,207 --> 00:02:26,580
This will open the script in MonoDevelop.

60
00:02:27,273 --> 00:02:29,273
MonoDevelop is a companion application

61
00:02:29,273 --> 00:02:31,177
that is bundled with Unity.

62
00:02:31,177 --> 00:02:33,177
This is the default script editor that comes

63
00:02:33,177 --> 00:02:35,177
with Unity, but you can use different

64
00:02:35,177 --> 00:02:37,288
script editors if you choose.

65
00:02:37,288 --> 00:02:39,288
For more information please see the details on

66
00:02:39,288 --> 00:02:42,028
using Unity with other editors linked below.

67
00:02:42,915 --> 00:02:46,265
Before we start I'm going to remove the sample code.

68
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:50,343
We will be moving our player ship using physics.

69
00:02:50,343 --> 00:02:53,548
So we will need to use the FixedUpdate function.

70
00:02:54,048 --> 00:02:56,048
For more information on both Update and

71
00:02:56,048 --> 00:02:58,048
FixedUpdate and how to use them

72
00:02:58,048 --> 00:03:00,048
see the information linked below.

73
00:03:01,128 --> 00:03:03,389
So now let's write some code.

74
00:03:03,389 --> 00:03:06,291
Write void FixedUpdate

75
00:03:08,145 --> 00:03:10,145
FixedUpdate will be called automatically

76
00:03:10,145 --> 00:03:13,172
by Unity just before each fixed physics step.

77
00:03:13,769 --> 00:03:15,795
All the code we put inside the fixedUpdate

78
00:03:15,795 --> 00:03:18,431
function will be executed once per physics step

79
00:03:19,056 --> 00:03:20,293
so write

80
00:03:20,293 --> 00:03:27,793
float moveHorizontal = input.GetAxis ("Horizontal")

81
00:03:27,793 --> 00:03:28,487
and

82
00:03:28,487 --> 00:03:34,421
float moveVertical = input.GetAxis ("Vertical")

83
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:38,006
This code grabs the input from the player.

84
00:03:38,506 --> 00:03:41,297
The axis horizontal and vertical are default

85
00:03:41,297 --> 00:03:43,992
axis that are preset in the input manager.

86
00:03:44,492 --> 00:03:46,492
Next we need to apply that input

87
00:03:46,492 --> 00:03:48,492
to the player game object.

88
00:03:49,296 --> 00:03:51,296
We are going to move the player game object

89
00:03:51,296 --> 00:03:53,667
using physics, and we are going to do this

90
00:03:53,667 --> 00:03:56,979
by affecting the velocity of the game object directly.

91
00:03:56,979 --> 00:03:58,979
Now this will result in non-realistic

92
00:03:58,979 --> 00:04:01,426
physics behaviour, by hey, that's alright,

93
00:04:01,426 --> 00:04:03,674
we are making an arcade game.

94
00:04:03,674 --> 00:04:05,674
If we want to make a game that works properly

95
00:04:05,674 --> 00:04:07,563
with Newtonian physics we would have

96
00:04:07,563 --> 00:04:09,563
approached this code differently.

97
00:04:10,823 --> 00:04:13,017
The rigidbody component which we attached

98
00:04:13,017 --> 00:04:15,017
when we set up the player game object

99
00:04:15,017 --> 00:04:17,910
is how we work with the built in physics engine.

100
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:19,910
The rigidbody includes properties

101
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:22,734
like UseGravity, Mass and  Drag

102
00:04:22,734 --> 00:04:25,530
that we can pole, affect and manipulate.

103
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:27,946
So if we want to change the physics velocity

104
00:04:27,946 --> 00:04:30,417
of the player game object we do this

105
00:04:30,417 --> 00:04:33,034
by addressing the rigidbody component.

106
00:04:33,911 --> 00:04:38,278
So let's write rigidbody.velocity

107
00:04:39,151 --> 00:04:42,722
Now rigidbody.velocity uses a Vector3 value.

108
00:04:42,722 --> 00:04:44,942
This gives us the direction we are travelling,

109
00:04:44,942 --> 00:04:46,942
and how fast we are travelling

110
00:04:46,942 --> 00:04:49,950
as a vector and it's magnitude.

111
00:04:50,712 --> 00:04:52,712
For more information on the Vector3 class

112
00:04:52,712 --> 00:04:54,712
and vector maths please see the

113
00:04:54,712 --> 00:04:56,152
details linked below.

114
00:04:57,295 --> 00:04:59,295
So our rigidbody velocity will be equal

115
00:04:59,295 --> 00:05:02,174
some vector3 value.

116
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:03,710
But what?

117
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:06,585
Well, as we know, a vector3 is made out of

118
00:05:06,585 --> 00:05:11,026
3 float numbers, an X, a Y and a Z value.

119
00:05:11,733 --> 00:05:15,041
Well, what do we put in these 3 float values?

120
00:05:15,541 --> 00:05:17,834
We want to use our player input.

121
00:05:18,386 --> 00:05:21,070
Let's walk through this one step at a time.

122
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:24,101
How much do we want to move on the Y axis?

123
00:05:24,101 --> 00:05:25,698
Or up and down?

124
00:05:26,198 --> 00:05:27,702
Well, none.

125
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:32,819
So Y equals 0.0f

126
00:05:33,126 --> 00:05:36,087
and if we write it this way, 0.0,

127
00:05:36,087 --> 00:05:38,768
we need the f to indicate to Unity that

128
00:05:38,768 --> 00:05:41,894
this decimal value is a floating point number.

129
00:05:42,477 --> 00:05:44,477
How much do we want to move left to right?

130
00:05:45,516 --> 00:05:48,283
Well, that's our moveHorizontal.

131
00:05:48,798 --> 00:05:50,798
Copy moveHorizontal and paste

132
00:05:50,798 --> 00:05:52,798
it over the X value.

133
00:05:55,467 --> 00:05:57,467
And forward and back?

134
00:05:58,561 --> 00:06:01,798
That's the value from moveVertical.

135
00:06:02,298 --> 00:06:04,726
Copy and paste moveVertical

136
00:06:06,138 --> 00:06:08,138
So how can we use this vector3

137
00:06:08,138 --> 00:06:09,804
now that we've made it?

138
00:06:10,304 --> 00:06:13,898
One way is to create a vector3 variable,

139
00:06:13,898 --> 00:06:15,814
let's call it Movement,

140
00:06:16,231 --> 00:06:18,231
and movement is equal to a

141
00:06:18,231 --> 00:06:24,558
new vector3 moveHorizontal, 0.0f, moveVertical.

142
00:06:25,058 --> 00:06:27,058
In C# we must remember to use

143
00:06:27,058 --> 00:06:29,058
the keyword here.

144
00:06:29,848 --> 00:06:34,309
and our rigidbody velocity is equal to movement.

145
00:06:37,861 --> 00:06:41,154
Now let's save this script and return to Unity.

146
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:44,653
The first thing we check is the console,

147
00:06:44,653 --> 00:06:46,653
to make sure that there are no errors

148
00:06:46,653 --> 00:06:49,554
and that everything we wrote has compiled properly.

149
00:06:50,054 --> 00:06:52,054
If there were an error we would also see

150
00:06:52,054 --> 00:06:54,842
this error in the footer, as our most recent error

151
00:06:54,842 --> 00:06:58,065
or message will always be shown in the footer.

152
00:06:59,048 --> 00:07:00,578
Let's test our code.

153
00:07:01,106 --> 00:07:03,985
Save the scene and enter Play mode.

154
00:07:06,087 --> 00:07:07,683
We can move our ship,

155
00:07:07,683 --> 00:07:10,527
but it's moving very very slowly.

156
00:07:10,527 --> 00:07:13,000
This is because inputGetAxis only returns

157
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,292
a number between 0 and 1.

158
00:07:15,292 --> 00:07:17,292
So our ship's movement with this code

159
00:07:17,292 --> 00:07:20,272
will never be more than 1 unit per second.

160
00:07:21,394 --> 00:07:23,394
Let's exit Play mode and return to our

161
00:07:23,394 --> 00:07:25,394
PlayerController script.

162
00:07:26,115 --> 00:07:28,582
We need control over our speed.

163
00:07:29,165 --> 00:07:31,165
So let's create a new public 

164
00:07:31,165 --> 00:07:33,933
float variable called Speed.

165
00:07:34,618 --> 00:07:36,618
This variable will hold a value we can

166
00:07:36,618 --> 00:07:39,198
use to multiply our input with

167
00:07:39,198 --> 00:07:42,626
as our input will only be a value of 0 to 1.

168
00:07:42,626 --> 00:07:45,276
By multiplying our input by Speed

169
00:07:45,276 --> 00:07:47,276
we will be able to move our ship from

170
00:07:47,276 --> 00:07:50,714
0 up to a maximum of our Speed value.

171
00:07:52,526 --> 00:07:56,759
Now, multiply our movement value by Speed.

172
00:07:58,723 --> 00:08:00,723
Let's return to Unity.

173
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,917
We did not assign a value to Speed in our script.

174
00:08:06,494 --> 00:08:09,151
Because we made Speed a public variable

175
00:08:09,151 --> 00:08:11,151
we can see it, we can set it and 

176
00:08:11,151 --> 00:08:13,890
we can change it value in Unity.

177
00:08:14,694 --> 00:08:17,189
Let's look at our player controller component.

178
00:08:17,189 --> 00:08:20,818
We can now see an editable property called Speed.

179
00:08:22,477 --> 00:08:25,149
Let's change it's value to 10.

180
00:08:25,149 --> 00:08:28,148
Now we save and play,

181
00:08:29,352 --> 00:08:32,346
and now we can move much faster around the game area.

182
00:08:32,346 --> 00:08:34,732
10 times faster as a matter of fact,

183
00:08:34,732 --> 00:08:36,871
but we have a problem,

184
00:08:36,871 --> 00:08:38,968
and that problem is our player ship

185
00:08:38,968 --> 00:08:40,968
can leave the game area.

186
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:43,886
We have no idea where the ship has gone,

187
00:08:43,886 --> 00:08:45,886
and it would be very easy to completely

188
00:08:45,886 --> 00:08:47,886
loose track of where our ship is.

189
00:08:48,717 --> 00:08:50,897
We need to constrain the ship

190
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:52,897
within the game area.

191
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,300
So leave Play mode and return

192
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,663
to our PlayerController script.

193
00:08:59,254 --> 00:09:01,254
We are moving our ship by setting

194
00:09:01,254 --> 00:09:03,254
the rigidbody's velocity.

195
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,920
We can constrain the ship

196
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,294
by setting the value of the rigidbody's position.

197
00:09:09,794 --> 00:09:11,794
Again, this won't give us realistic

198
00:09:11,794 --> 00:09:13,794
physics behaviour, but in our

199
00:09:13,794 --> 00:09:15,794
case it's not necessary.

200
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:18,722
Unity executes our code within a given

201
00:09:18,722 --> 00:09:22,329
function 1 line at a time from top to bottom.

202
00:09:22,829 --> 00:09:26,068
The code we have written moves our player ship.

203
00:09:26,068 --> 00:09:28,068
We will write code that will come after

204
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:30,012
the code that moves our ship

205
00:09:30,012 --> 00:09:32,712
and if we have moved outside of the game

206
00:09:32,712 --> 00:09:34,712
the code will set the player's position

207
00:09:34,712 --> 00:09:36,712
back to the edge of the game area.

208
00:09:37,433 --> 00:09:39,737
Because Unity will read and execute

209
00:09:39,737 --> 00:09:42,316
all of the code in our relevant function

210
00:09:42,316 --> 00:09:44,316
before updating the frame

211
00:09:44,316 --> 00:09:47,234
the ship itself will never leave the game area.

212
00:09:48,231 --> 00:09:49,566
So let's write

213
00:09:49,566 --> 00:09:52,454
rigidbody.position

214
00:09:52,454 --> 00:09:54,928
and this is the property we want to set,

215
00:09:55,538 --> 00:09:57,068
and then write

216
00:09:57,068 --> 00:10:02,116
new vector3 (X,Y, Z)

217
00:10:02,116 --> 00:10:05,184
and this is the value we want to set it to.

218
00:10:06,306 --> 00:10:08,306
The code we are going to write next

219
00:10:08,306 --> 00:10:10,734
will make 1 very long line.

220
00:10:10,734 --> 00:10:12,734
So I'm going to break this code over

221
00:10:12,734 --> 00:10:14,734
several lines vertically.

222
00:10:14,734 --> 00:10:17,838
This will all be the same instruction to the compiler.

223
00:10:18,338 --> 00:10:20,338
I'm going to follow the same indenting and

224
00:10:20,338 --> 00:10:22,589
bracket conventions that we are already using

225
00:10:22,589 --> 00:10:24,589
for organisation and readability.

226
00:10:26,069 --> 00:10:27,315
Let's think about how much we want

227
00:10:27,315 --> 00:10:28,839
to limit our movement.

228
00:10:29,387 --> 00:10:32,068
How much margin do we want up and down?

229
00:10:32,068 --> 00:10:32,985
None.

230
00:10:32,985 --> 00:10:34,985
Our player game object should never leave

231
00:10:34,985 --> 00:10:36,985
the plane of the game.

232
00:10:36,985 --> 00:10:39,991
The Y value, let's set this to 0.

233
00:10:40,532 --> 00:10:43,558
But what about left/right and forward/back?

234
00:10:43,558 --> 00:10:46,200
The ship is moving along the X/Z plane

235
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:49,090
and we want to clamp it within the game area.

236
00:10:50,405 --> 00:10:54,274
The ship starts at origin, or (0, 0, 0)

237
00:10:54,274 --> 00:10:57,258
so we want to set limits on all 4 directions

238
00:10:57,258 --> 00:10:59,258
along the X/Z plane.

239
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:03,291
Let's return to our script.,

240
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:08,735
So write Mathf.

241
00:11:09,884 --> 00:11:11,357
What is Mathf?

242
00:11:11,857 --> 00:11:14,229
Well let's look this up in the documentation.

243
00:11:14,909 --> 00:11:16,909
And remember the shortcut to Unity's

244
00:11:16,909 --> 00:11:19,634
scripting reference in the documentation is

245
00:11:19,634 --> 00:11:22,474
command+' on the mac

246
00:11:22,474 --> 00:11:25,460
and control+' on windows.

247
00:11:27,977 --> 00:11:30,668
Mathf is well worth remembering.

248
00:11:30,668 --> 00:11:32,668
It is a collection of really useful

249
00:11:32,668 --> 00:11:34,543
easy to use math functions.

250
00:11:35,113 --> 00:11:37,322
These include variables like Epsilon

251
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:39,322
Infinity and Pi,

252
00:11:39,322 --> 00:11:42,637
and functions like Sine, Cosine, Tangent,

253
00:11:42,637 --> 00:11:45,531
Square Root, Power, PingPong, Repeat,

254
00:11:45,531 --> 00:11:48,029
and even Perlin Noise Generation.

255
00:11:48,709 --> 00:11:52,359
What we are looking for is a function called Clamp.

256
00:11:54,586 --> 00:11:56,792
Clamp will clamp any given value

257
00:11:56,792 --> 00:11:59,218
between a minimum and a maximum value.

258
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:01,218
We will use this to clamp the position of

259
00:12:01,218 --> 00:12:04,028
our player's ship in to our game area.

260
00:12:04,597 --> 00:12:07,321
Returning to our script let's write

261
00:12:07,321 --> 00:12:15,598
Clamp (rigibody.position.x, xMin, xMax)

262
00:12:15,598 --> 00:12:17,846
and for Z let's write

263
00:12:17,846 --> 00:12:25,826
Mathf.Clamp (rigidbody.position.z, xMin xMax)

264
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:28,991
This will effectively clamp our position

265
00:12:28,991 --> 00:12:30,991
between the values we set for our min

266
00:12:30,991 --> 00:12:34,147
and our max on the X and Z axis.

267
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:39,493
Now we need to declare our min and max values.

268
00:12:39,493 --> 00:12:41,801
At the top of our script write

269
00:12:41,801 --> 00:12:49,099
public float xMin, xMax, ZMin, zMax

270
00:12:49,571 --> 00:12:52,390
and using this format we can define

271
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:56,253
all 4 float variables on 1 line of code.

272
00:12:57,665 --> 00:13:00,387
Save the script and return to Unity.

273
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:03,799
Let's look at our player controller component

274
00:13:03,799 --> 00:13:05,620
on the player game object.

275
00:13:05,872 --> 00:13:07,721
We can see these new properties

276
00:13:07,721 --> 00:13:09,721
but to me they seem to take up a large

277
00:13:09,721 --> 00:13:11,555
amount of space in the Inspector.

278
00:13:12,097 --> 00:13:14,358
Moreover, these properties can

279
00:13:14,358 --> 00:13:16,358
only be used by this script.

280
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:18,982
There is a way that we can both clean up

281
00:13:18,982 --> 00:13:21,522
this code and make it reusable.

282
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:23,855
That is to put these in to a separate

283
00:13:23,855 --> 00:13:25,589
class of their own.

284
00:13:26,424 --> 00:13:28,424
Let's return to our script

285
00:13:28,424 --> 00:13:30,922
and let's move these in to their own class.

286
00:13:31,615 --> 00:13:35,042
We start by defining a new class with

287
00:13:35,042 --> 00:13:36,986
public class

288
00:13:36,986 --> 00:13:39,848
and then we will name our class Boundary.

289
00:13:40,348 --> 00:13:43,332
We will follow these with brackets to hold our code.

290
00:13:43,832 --> 00:13:45,832
It's worth noting that this class

291
00:13:45,832 --> 00:13:47,832
will not inherit from anything

292
00:13:47,832 --> 00:13:50,485
like our PlayerController class does.

293
00:13:51,095 --> 00:13:55,443
The : MonoBehaviour that comes after the class name

294
00:13:55,443 --> 00:13:58,360
in our PlayerController class indicates that

295
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:02,131
this class is inheriting from MonoBehaviour.

296
00:14:02,686 --> 00:14:04,686
For more information on classes

297
00:14:04,686 --> 00:14:07,140
inheritance and monobehaviour

298
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:09,554
please see the information linked below.

299
00:14:10,814 --> 00:14:14,167
Next, let's move our variable definitions from

300
00:14:14,167 --> 00:14:17,238
PlayerController to Boundary.

301
00:14:18,898 --> 00:14:22,004
So how do we use this new Boundary class?

302
00:14:22,711 --> 00:14:24,711
First we need to make an instance of it

303
00:14:24,711 --> 00:14:26,711
in our PlayerController.

304
00:14:26,711 --> 00:14:32,195
So write public Boundary boundary;

305
00:14:32,195 --> 00:14:34,195
and note the capitalisation.

306
00:14:35,109 --> 00:14:37,442
Boundary with a capital B is our type

307
00:14:37,442 --> 00:14:39,635
as defined by the class name.

308
00:14:39,635 --> 00:14:41,635
Boundary with a lowercase b is

309
00:14:41,635 --> 00:14:44,193
the name for our reference in the same way

310
00:14:44,193 --> 00:14:46,923
that Speed is the name for our float variable.

311
00:14:48,183 --> 00:14:50,183
Next we need to update our Clamp code

312
00:14:50,183 --> 00:14:52,937
to reflect the changes that we have just made.

313
00:14:52,937 --> 00:14:55,895
xMin is now part of our Boundary class,

314
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:58,132
which we access through the reference

315
00:14:58,132 --> 00:15:00,312
that we made to our instance

316
00:15:00,312 --> 00:15:03,133
by using Boundary.xMin.

317
00:15:03,633 --> 00:15:06,297
This is true for xMax, 

318
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:09,234
zMin,

319
00:15:09,775 --> 00:15:11,775
and zMax as well.

320
00:15:12,537 --> 00:15:14,025
Let's make our code neat and tidy

321
00:15:14,025 --> 00:15:16,025
by aligning our indents.

322
00:15:16,525 --> 00:15:18,859
Save the script, switch back to Unity

323
00:15:18,859 --> 00:15:21,287
and let's look at the updated component.

324
00:15:23,099 --> 00:15:25,099
Hmm, now we can't see our new updated

325
00:15:25,099 --> 00:15:26,946
properties at all.

326
00:15:27,446 --> 00:15:29,006
This is because the new class

327
00:15:29,006 --> 00:15:32,033
that we have created is unknown to

328
00:15:32,033 --> 00:15:34,894
and is therefore not serialised.

329
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:37,670
Serialising is a way of storing 

330
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,808
and transferring information

331
00:15:39,808 --> 00:15:42,715
Serialisation is a complicated issue.

332
00:15:42,715 --> 00:15:45,322
At this point, just understanding

333
00:15:45,322 --> 00:15:47,599
that Unity needs to have properties

334
00:15:47,599 --> 00:15:50,097
serialised to view them in the Inspector

335
00:15:50,597 --> 00:15:53,029
So let's switch back to our script.

336
00:15:53,626 --> 00:15:56,491
To serialise our new class we need to use

337
00:15:56,491 --> 00:15:59,075
[system.serializable]

338
00:15:59,075 --> 00:16:01,075
in square brackets on the line before

339
00:16:01,075 --> 00:16:03,075
we declare our class to make sure

340
00:16:03,075 --> 00:16:05,270
that the class is serialised

341
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:07,842
and therefore visible in the Inspector.

342
00:16:09,234 --> 00:16:12,009
Save the script and return to Unity.

343
00:16:13,255 --> 00:16:16,023
Now if we look back at our Player Controller

344
00:16:16,023 --> 00:16:18,023
we can see Boundary.

345
00:16:18,023 --> 00:16:20,023
Turn down the gizmo and we can now see our

346
00:16:20,023 --> 00:16:22,176
properties in an easy to use

347
00:16:22,176 --> 00:16:24,176
but very tidy container.

348
00:16:24,676 --> 00:16:26,676
We can also use this class in

349
00:16:26,676 --> 00:16:28,396
other places in our game.

350
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:31,694
Now that we have our properties available to us

351
00:16:31,694 --> 00:16:33,347
let's set their values.

352
00:16:33,945 --> 00:16:36,843
Make sure that we have the player ship selected.

353
00:16:36,843 --> 00:16:38,691
So what values do we need to set

354
00:16:38,691 --> 00:16:40,691
for xMin and xMax?

355
00:16:41,191 --> 00:16:43,915
Simply drag the ship to the edge of the game area

356
00:16:43,915 --> 00:16:46,855
and note the values on the X axis.

357
00:16:46,855 --> 00:16:51,030
These seem to be about -6 and 6.

358
00:16:51,502 --> 00:16:53,723
So let's set these values to a good round

359
00:16:53,723 --> 00:16:55,723
-6 and 6.

360
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:01,234
Doing the same thing along the Z axis,

361
00:17:01,234 --> 00:17:04,326
that's about -4 along the bottom

362
00:17:04,826 --> 00:17:07,143
but along the top edge we don't really

363
00:17:07,143 --> 00:17:08,768
want to give our player access to the

364
00:17:08,768 --> 00:17:10,768
entire upper game area.

365
00:17:10,768 --> 00:17:13,257
We will need to give the hazards in our game

366
00:17:13,257 --> 00:17:16,363
some room to be able to enter the game area.

367
00:17:16,363 --> 00:17:18,363
So let's back off a little bit

368
00:17:18,363 --> 00:17:21,460
say about 7 or 8.

369
00:17:22,872 --> 00:17:27,606
Let's make zMin and zMax -4 and 8.

370
00:17:28,106 --> 00:17:30,106
This will give us a square playable area

371
00:17:30,106 --> 00:17:32,603
in our game and reserve

372
00:17:32,603 --> 00:17:34,982
a little room for hazards at the top.

373
00:17:36,117 --> 00:17:38,821
Now let's reset the player's transform

374
00:17:38,821 --> 00:17:40,419
and let's test.

375
00:17:41,045 --> 00:17:43,045
Enter Play mode,

376
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:45,833
and we can see that we are now clamped

377
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:47,833
inside the game area.

378
00:17:51,979 --> 00:17:53,606
Exit Play mode.

379
00:17:53,606 --> 00:17:55,454
Now we are essentially done with our 

380
00:17:55,454 --> 00:17:57,817
player game object, but I think it's worth

381
00:17:57,817 --> 00:18:00,888
adding 1 bit of fun to it before we move on.

382
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:03,738
Let's add some bank, or tilt to the

383
00:18:03,738 --> 00:18:06,030
player ship when we move from side

384
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:08,030
to side along the X axis.

385
00:18:08,972 --> 00:18:11,483
Switch to our script and let's create

386
00:18:11,483 --> 00:18:14,599
a new variable to hold our tilt value.

387
00:18:16,466 --> 00:18:18,797
Next, after the code we have written

388
00:18:18,797 --> 00:18:21,810
but still in FixedUpdate write

389
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:26,805
rigidbody.rotation = Quaternion.Euler.

390
00:18:27,236 --> 00:18:29,236
And yes, it is pronounced oiler,

391
00:18:30,026 --> 00:18:33,547
which is also an X, Y and Z value.

392
00:18:35,152 --> 00:18:37,152
For more information on Quaternions and

393
00:18:37,152 --> 00:18:39,733
Quaternion.Euler see the links below.

394
00:18:41,352 --> 00:18:43,352
We only want to tilt, or bank,

395
00:18:43,352 --> 00:18:45,352
along the Z axis

396
00:18:45,352 --> 00:18:48,540
so X and Y are set to 0.

397
00:18:49,233 --> 00:18:50,815
And Z?

398
00:18:50,815 --> 00:18:52,815
We want the tilt along the Z axis to

399
00:18:52,815 --> 00:18:54,815
be related to how fast we are moving

400
00:18:54,815 --> 00:18:58,136
left to right, so our rotation on the Z axis

401
00:18:58,136 --> 00:19:04,498
is equal to our rigidbody.velocity X

402
00:19:05,163 --> 00:19:07,749
which is our velocity from left to right

403
00:19:07,749 --> 00:19:10,948
multiplied by our tilt factor.

404
00:19:10,948 --> 00:19:13,859
So we can control the maximum amount of bank.

405
00:19:14,356 --> 00:19:17,223
The only correction we need to make this code is

406
00:19:17,223 --> 00:19:20,267
to multiply by negative tilt.

407
00:19:20,267 --> 00:19:22,267
Otherwise our ship will tilt in the opposite

408
00:19:22,267 --> 00:19:24,267
direction to what we want.

409
00:19:25,112 --> 00:19:27,708
Save the script and return to Unity

410
00:19:28,816 --> 00:19:30,816
and let's set the tilt value.

411
00:19:31,606 --> 00:19:33,606
Let's try 3.

412
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:39,310
If we feel it needs to tilt more

413
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:41,310
we can simply adjust the tilt property

414
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:43,199
with a higher value.

415
00:19:43,199 --> 00:19:45,199
Let's try 4.

416
00:19:49,801 --> 00:19:51,345
4 feels good.

417
00:19:51,749 --> 00:19:54,644
Incidentally, when the ship is banked over

418
00:19:54,644 --> 00:19:56,644
it picks up a good combination

419
00:19:56,644 --> 00:19:59,349
of our fill and rim lights on the left side.

420
00:20:02,528 --> 00:20:05,756
That completes the code for moving our player ship.

421
00:20:05,756 --> 00:20:07,756
In the next assignment we will continue with

422
00:20:07,756 --> 00:20:09,922
our game play by creating shots

423
00:20:09,922 --> 00:20:11,922
for our player to shoot.
