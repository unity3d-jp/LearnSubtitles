1
00:00:01,312 --> 00:00:03,951
So we have a tumbling asteroid hazard

2
00:00:03,951 --> 00:00:06,854
and we can destroy it with our laser bolts.

3
00:00:06,854 --> 00:00:09,738
But the entire process seems a bit dull.

4
00:00:09,738 --> 00:00:12,578
So let's add some explosions to brighten things up.

5
00:00:13,907 --> 00:00:16,957
Let's open our DestroyByContact script.

6
00:00:19,736 --> 00:00:22,098
The first thing we need to do is add a reference

7
00:00:22,098 --> 00:00:24,486
to our explosion visual effect.

8
00:00:24,486 --> 00:00:28,652
So let's write public GameObject explosion

9
00:00:29,483 --> 00:00:33,062
then after our boundary detection code

10
00:00:33,062 --> 00:00:35,117
write instantiate.

11
00:00:35,617 --> 00:00:37,617
We know instantiate, we've used it in

12
00:00:37,617 --> 00:00:39,617
our Player Controller script.

13
00:00:40,283 --> 00:00:42,283
Let's open our Player Controller script.

14
00:00:43,764 --> 00:00:46,366
And copy the instantiate line.

15
00:00:47,977 --> 00:00:51,296
Paste it in to our DestroyByContact script.

16
00:00:52,086 --> 00:00:54,086
What do we want to instantiate?

17
00:00:54,586 --> 00:00:56,074
Our explosion.

18
00:00:56,574 --> 00:00:58,505
Where do we want to instantiate it?

19
00:00:58,505 --> 00:01:01,917
At our transform position with our

20
00:01:01,917 --> 00:01:03,917
transform rotation applied.

21
00:01:04,417 --> 00:01:06,529
This will instantiate the explosion

22
00:01:06,529 --> 00:01:09,542
at the exact same position as our asteroid.

23
00:01:10,525 --> 00:01:13,351
Save this script and return to Unity.

24
00:01:14,434 --> 00:01:18,382
In the Prefabs folder is VFX Explosions.

25
00:01:19,352 --> 00:01:21,629
Drag the explosion_asteroid on to the

26
00:01:21,629 --> 00:01:24,097
Explosion slot to create a reference to it

27
00:01:24,097 --> 00:01:26,719
on our DestroyByContact script.

28
00:01:27,467 --> 00:01:30,037
Save the scene and enter Play mode.x

29
00:01:31,583 --> 00:01:33,486
Now when we destroy the asteroid we get a

30
00:01:33,486 --> 00:01:35,238
very pretty explosion.

31
00:01:35,238 --> 00:01:37,238
Let's see that again.

32
00:01:40,128 --> 00:01:41,363
Nice.

33
00:01:42,421 --> 00:01:43,906
On the other hand

34
00:01:44,503 --> 00:01:46,931
If we ram the asteroid with our ship

35
00:01:48,315 --> 00:01:50,315
We only get that same explosion.

36
00:01:50,732 --> 00:01:52,732
Now that's a little sad.

37
00:01:52,732 --> 00:01:55,230
Let's improve this script to accommodate

38
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:57,465
the player as a special case and include

39
00:01:57,465 --> 00:01:58,907
a player explosion as well as

40
00:01:58,907 --> 00:02:00,907
the asteroid explosion.

41
00:02:02,401 --> 00:02:05,403
Return to our DestroyByContact script.

42
00:02:06,199 --> 00:02:08,790
Let's add a public GameObject reference

43
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:10,790
to our playerExplosion.

44
00:02:12,367 --> 00:02:15,051
Then let's duplicate our instantiate code

45
00:02:15,827 --> 00:02:18,835
and again, what do we want to instantiate?

46
00:02:18,835 --> 00:02:20,890
Our playerExplosion.

47
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:23,363
And where do we want to instantiate it?

48
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:26,607
Where our player, as the other collider

49
00:02:26,607 --> 00:02:30,405
is in our scene, or the Other

50
00:02:30,405 --> 00:02:32,765
transform position and the Other

51
00:02:32,765 --> 00:02:34,375
transform rotation.

52
00:02:35,127 --> 00:02:37,127
Leaving the code like this would simply

53
00:02:37,127 --> 00:02:39,127
instantiate 2 explosions with every

54
00:02:39,127 --> 00:02:40,811
OnTriggerEnter event.

55
00:02:41,282 --> 00:02:43,899
Let's test the Other collider again.

56
00:02:43,899 --> 00:02:46,718
Indent the new instantiate code and write

57
00:02:47,619 --> 00:02:51,261
If the other collider's tag is the

58
00:02:51,261 --> 00:02:53,261
same as Player

59
00:02:53,968 --> 00:02:55,692
and add an open bracket.

60
00:02:56,385 --> 00:02:58,605
And after the instantiate line we will

61
00:02:58,605 --> 00:03:01,512
need to complete this with a close bracket.

62
00:03:02,896 --> 00:03:05,901
We will now always instantiate our explosions

63
00:03:05,901 --> 00:03:08,523
but if we collide with an object tagged Player

64
00:03:08,523 --> 00:03:10,486
we will also instantiate a player

65
00:03:10,486 --> 00:03:11,851
explosion as well.

66
00:03:12,516 --> 00:03:15,295
Save this script and return to Unity.

67
00:03:16,176 --> 00:03:18,023
Our player now needs a tag.

68
00:03:18,455 --> 00:03:20,455
Using the Tag drop-down menu select the

69
00:03:20,455 --> 00:03:22,788
pre-made tag Player.

70
00:03:23,468 --> 00:03:26,758
There is no need to create a custom tag in this case.

71
00:03:27,797 --> 00:03:29,797
Select the Asteroid game object

72
00:03:29,797 --> 00:03:32,401
and drag the explosion_player on to the

73
00:03:32,401 --> 00:03:34,304
Player Explosion slot on the

74
00:03:34,304 --> 00:03:36,304
DestroyByContact component.

75
00:03:36,956 --> 00:03:39,343
Save the scene and play.

76
00:03:41,445 --> 00:03:43,445
Wow, that's great.

77
00:03:44,346 --> 00:03:46,346
The last improvement we need to make on the

78
00:03:46,346 --> 00:03:48,969
asteroid is to get it moving towards the player

79
00:03:49,785 --> 00:03:51,840
With the Asteroid selected

80
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,977
open the Scripts folder and drag the

81
00:03:53,977 --> 00:03:56,281
Mover script on to the Asteroid

82
00:03:56,281 --> 00:03:58,281
game object in the Inspector.

83
00:03:58,698 --> 00:04:00,698
The Mover script is the movement

84
00:04:00,698 --> 00:04:02,698
code we created when we were moving the bolt

85
00:04:02,698 --> 00:04:05,324
game object in an earlier assignment.

86
00:04:06,289 --> 00:04:10,410
Then set the speed value to -5.

87
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:13,159
This negative speed will bring the asteroid

88
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:15,159
down the screen towards our player.

89
00:04:16,543 --> 00:04:19,810
Save the scene, enter Play mode and test.

90
00:04:20,434 --> 00:04:22,782
And the asteroid tumbles towards our player.

91
00:04:23,514 --> 00:04:25,986
Conveniently the boundary also takes care

92
00:04:25,986 --> 00:04:27,986
of the asteroid when it leaves the boundary's

93
00:04:27,986 --> 00:04:29,986
box by destroying it.

94
00:04:31,163 --> 00:04:33,163
Exit Play mode.

95
00:04:33,994 --> 00:04:35,953
The asteroid hazard is done.

96
00:04:35,953 --> 00:04:38,339
We need to save this as a prefab

97
00:04:38,339 --> 00:04:40,339
So drag the asteroid game object from the

98
00:04:40,339 --> 00:04:43,940
Hierarchy on to the Prefabs folder in Assets.

99
00:04:44,964 --> 00:04:46,964
This creates a new prefab of our

100
00:04:46,964 --> 00:04:48,964
Asteroid game object.

101
00:04:49,878 --> 00:04:51,878
Lastly delete the instance of

102
00:04:51,878 --> 00:04:53,878
the asteroid from our scene.

103
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:57,789
Our asteroid hazard is setup and ready to go.

104
00:04:57,789 --> 00:04:59,664
In the next assignment we will create

105
00:04:59,664 --> 00:05:01,664
our game controller.
