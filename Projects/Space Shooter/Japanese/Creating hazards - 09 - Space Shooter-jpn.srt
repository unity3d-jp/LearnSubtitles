1
00:00:01,547 --> 00:00:04,774
Our player is powered up, armed and ready to go.

2
00:00:04,774 --> 00:00:07,536
Let's create some hazards to challenge our player.

3
00:00:08,271 --> 00:00:10,648
We will be creating an asteroid prefab to

4
00:00:10,648 --> 00:00:12,806
throw at our player and we will use an

5
00:00:12,806 --> 00:00:14,806
architecture similar to the one we used

6
00:00:14,806 --> 00:00:16,806
to make the Bolt prefab.

7
00:00:17,306 --> 00:00:19,791
We will have a parent game object for the logic

8
00:00:19,791 --> 00:00:21,791
and the artwork will be a child.

9
00:00:22,346 --> 00:00:25,298
To start, let's create a new game object

10
00:00:25,298 --> 00:00:27,298
and rename it Asteroid.

11
00:00:27,798 --> 00:00:30,931
Reset the asteroid's transform to origin

12
00:00:30,931 --> 00:00:33,948
and move it up along the Z axis to about 8.

13
00:00:34,448 --> 00:00:36,599
By moving the asteroid parent a little further

14
00:00:36,599 --> 00:00:38,970
up the game area it will both separate

15
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:41,292
the asteroid from the player while we build it

16
00:00:41,292 --> 00:00:44,394
and allow us to easily test it when we are finished.

17
00:00:45,708 --> 00:00:48,765
Next let's get some artwork for our asteroid.

18
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:52,284
If we open the Models folder in Assets

19
00:00:52,284 --> 00:00:54,754
we have 3 asteroid models to choose from.

20
00:00:55,406 --> 00:00:57,406
We are going to use the first one.

21
00:00:57,851 --> 00:00:59,851
Select the asteroid model and drag it on

22
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:02,467
to the Asteroid parent game object.

23
00:01:02,939 --> 00:01:04,939
When we drop it the Asteroid model will

24
00:01:04,939 --> 00:01:07,833
be a child of the Asteroid game object.

25
00:01:09,687 --> 00:01:12,253
I am going to reset the model's transform.

26
00:01:12,253 --> 00:01:14,584
By resetting the entire transform

27
00:01:14,584 --> 00:01:17,437
the model will be centred on the parent game object

28
00:01:17,437 --> 00:01:20,149
with no relative rotation and a scale of 1

29
00:01:20,149 --> 00:01:22,149
relative to the parent game object.

30
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:25,519
For our game it's important that the transform's

31
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:27,835
position be at local origin.

32
00:01:28,694 --> 00:01:30,777
The game is designed to work with the asteroid

33
00:01:30,777 --> 00:01:33,096
model at a local scale of 1.

34
00:01:33,096 --> 00:01:35,096
But we may find it interesting to experiment

35
00:01:35,096 --> 00:01:37,732
with local scale after we are done with this project

36
00:01:37,732 --> 00:01:40,271
to see how it changes the game and gameplay.

37
00:01:41,876 --> 00:01:43,876
With our artwork in place let's setup

38
00:01:43,876 --> 00:01:45,876
the components and logic.

39
00:01:45,876 --> 00:01:48,473
Select the parent Asteroid game object

40
00:01:48,473 --> 00:01:50,473
and use the Add Component button to

41
00:01:50,473 --> 00:01:53,750
add a physics rigidbody.

42
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:57,336
As our game is playing along the X/Z plane

43
00:01:57,336 --> 00:02:00,065
deselect Use Gravity so the asteroid

44
00:02:00,065 --> 00:02:02,454
does not fall in to the void.

45
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:06,484
Now let's use the Add Component again

46
00:02:06,484 --> 00:02:09,128
to add a physics capsule collider.

47
00:02:10,393 --> 00:02:12,738
Again we have what looks like a green wire

48
00:02:12,738 --> 00:02:14,738
sphere around our asteroid.

49
00:02:14,738 --> 00:02:16,738
We need to change the radius and the height

50
00:02:16,738 --> 00:02:18,738
of the capsule collider to more accurately

51
00:02:18,738 --> 00:02:20,738
match our model.

52
00:02:20,738 --> 00:02:22,738
Now we could try to set these using the

53
00:02:22,738 --> 00:02:25,042
properties on the component.

54
00:02:25,042 --> 00:02:28,437
But this is a less than ideal way of doing things.

55
00:02:29,061 --> 00:02:31,294
We can however change the shape of the

56
00:02:31,294 --> 00:02:33,766
capsule collider directly in the Scene view.

57
00:02:34,277 --> 00:02:36,906
The trick here is to hold down the shift key.

58
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:39,250
When we hold down the shift key drag handles

59
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:41,028
appear on the collider.

60
00:02:41,028 --> 00:02:43,028
With these we can simply drag the collider

61
00:02:43,028 --> 00:02:45,028
shape until we are satisfied.

62
00:02:46,481 --> 00:02:49,286
Now that we have our basic physics component setup

63
00:02:49,286 --> 00:02:51,931
let's save the scene and enter Play mode.

64
00:02:53,774 --> 00:02:57,048
Wow, that's one boring asteroid.

65
00:02:57,728 --> 00:02:59,728
Exit Play mode.

66
00:03:00,352 --> 00:03:02,786
Let's give it some life and make it tumble.

67
00:03:04,095 --> 00:03:06,439
With the asteroid game object selected

68
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:08,843
use the Add Component button to

69
00:03:08,843 --> 00:03:10,843
create a new script.

70
00:03:11,716 --> 00:03:14,681
Rename the script RandomRotator.

71
00:03:15,982 --> 00:03:17,529
and accept the changes to add

72
00:03:17,529 --> 00:03:19,529
this script to Asteroid.

73
00:03:20,664 --> 00:03:22,971
Select Assets and file the new script

74
00:03:22,971 --> 00:03:24,971
in to the Scripts folder.

75
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:28,228
Open the Scripts folder and select RandomRotator

76
00:03:28,228 --> 00:03:30,228
and open the script for editing.

77
00:03:33,877 --> 00:03:36,863
The first thing we want to do is create a public

78
00:03:36,863 --> 00:03:39,030
float called Tumble

79
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:41,627
to hold our maximum tumble value

80
00:03:41,627 --> 00:03:44,100
which we will be able to set in the Editor.

81
00:03:45,411 --> 00:03:47,411
Now in Start

82
00:03:48,671 --> 00:03:52,648
we want to set our rigidbody's angular velocity.

83
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:57,175
What is angular velocity?

84
00:03:57,175 --> 00:03:59,853
Angular velocity is how fast a rigidbody

85
00:03:59,853 --> 00:04:01,546
object is rotating

86
00:04:02,046 --> 00:04:04,966
and we want to set our angular velocity to

87
00:04:04,966 --> 00:04:06,966
some random value.

88
00:04:08,046 --> 00:04:10,753
Now Unity has a Random class

89
00:04:10,753 --> 00:04:12,753
and it's very convenient for giving us all

90
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:14,574
sorts of random values.

91
00:04:14,574 --> 00:04:18,028
The most basic is literally random value.

92
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:20,834
This will return a random float value

93
00:04:20,834 --> 00:04:23,128
between 0 and 1

94
00:04:23,128 --> 00:04:24,408
and then we can do anything we want

95
00:04:24,408 --> 00:04:26,574
to with this random number.

96
00:04:26,574 --> 00:04:28,574
But there are several more interesting items in

97
00:04:28,574 --> 00:04:30,993
the Random class that can give us more complex

98
00:04:30,993 --> 00:04:32,918
and more useful values if we look at the

99
00:04:32,918 --> 00:04:34,726
class in detail.

100
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,801
For our asteroid let's look at

101
00:04:36,801 --> 00:04:39,683
Random.InsideUnitSphere.

102
00:04:42,644 --> 00:04:44,905
This may sound intimidating, and it may also 

103
00:04:44,905 --> 00:04:46,905
sound like it has nothing to do with tumbling

104
00:04:46,905 --> 00:04:49,753
an asteroid, but in actuality it is

105
00:04:49,753 --> 00:04:51,311
everything that we need.

106
00:04:51,311 --> 00:04:53,311
InsideUnitySphere gives us a random

107
00:04:53,311 --> 00:04:56,629
vector3 value that we can apply to our

108
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:59,338
rigidbody's angular velocity.

109
00:04:59,338 --> 00:05:02,302
And each of the 3 X, Y and Z values

110
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,302
will be randomised individually.

111
00:05:06,225 --> 00:05:08,995
Copy Random.InsideUnitSphere

112
00:05:08,995 --> 00:05:10,995
and paste it in to our code

113
00:05:10,995 --> 00:05:13,782
and multiply it by Tumble.

114
00:05:14,821 --> 00:05:17,057
This simple script takes our tumble value

115
00:05:17,057 --> 00:05:19,390
from the Editor and at start

116
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:23,211
we set the new asteroid's rigidbody.angularVelocity

117
00:05:23,211 --> 00:05:25,211
to a random vector3 value from

118
00:05:25,211 --> 00:05:27,487
Random.InsideUnitSphere.

119
00:05:27,487 --> 00:05:30,129
and then we multiply this by tumble.

120
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,471
Save the script and return to Unity.

121
00:05:36,029 --> 00:05:38,471
Select Asteroid and let's set the

122
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:40,471
tumble value to 5.

123
00:05:41,559 --> 00:05:44,171
Save the scene and enter Play mode to test.

124
00:05:44,934 --> 00:05:47,525
And our asteroid now has a random tumble.

125
00:05:48,257 --> 00:05:50,821
Let's enter and exit Play mode a few more times.

126
00:05:51,539 --> 00:05:54,708
We can see that every time the script calls Start

127
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:57,452
we get a different random angular velocity.

128
00:05:58,712 --> 00:06:00,411
If, however, we leave it for a short

129
00:06:00,411 --> 00:06:01,840
period of time

130
00:06:02,764 --> 00:06:04,764
the asteroid slows to a stop.

131
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,700
This is due to a default value

132
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,493
on the rigidbody component.

133
00:06:11,089 --> 00:06:13,423
The rigidbody has 2 parameters to simulate

134
00:06:13,423 --> 00:06:15,927
resistance, like air friction,

135
00:06:15,927 --> 00:06:19,033
and these are Drag and Angular Drag.

136
00:06:19,683 --> 00:06:21,683
Angular Drag by default has a small

137
00:06:21,683 --> 00:06:23,683
but working value.

138
00:06:24,853 --> 00:06:26,186
Exit Play mode.

139
00:06:27,558 --> 00:06:29,980
Let's drop this value to 0.

140
00:06:31,042 --> 00:06:32,376
Enter Play mode.

141
00:06:33,282 --> 00:06:35,717
Now our asteroid has now angular drag

142
00:06:35,717 --> 00:06:38,279
being applied to it's angular velocity

143
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:40,279
so it will keep tumbling until it's destroyed

144
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:42,957
by the player or by the boundary.

145
00:06:43,594 --> 00:06:44,896
Exit Play mode.

146
00:06:46,094 --> 00:06:47,956
Speaking of which, what happens if our

147
00:06:47,956 --> 00:06:49,956
player tries to shoot the asteroid?

148
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:52,402
Enter Play mode.

149
00:06:56,676 --> 00:06:57,732
Nothing.

150
00:06:58,464 --> 00:07:00,741
Our asteroid has a collider on it

151
00:07:00,741 --> 00:07:02,741
and so do our laser bolts.

152
00:07:02,741 --> 00:07:04,741
Why don't we see any interaction?

153
00:07:05,387 --> 00:07:07,988
That's because they are both trigger colliders

154
00:07:07,988 --> 00:07:10,891
and triggers don't have physical collisions,

155
00:07:10,891 --> 00:07:12,214
and we have written nothing that can

156
00:07:12,214 --> 00:07:13,935
capture the trigger event.

157
00:07:14,435 --> 00:07:16,435
We will need to write more trigger related

158
00:07:16,435 --> 00:07:19,406
code for our 2 colliders to have any effect.

159
00:07:20,257 --> 00:07:22,257
Exit Play mode.

160
00:07:23,896 --> 00:07:27,144
With Asteroid selected use the Add Component

161
00:07:27,144 --> 00:07:29,681
button to create a new script.

162
00:07:30,809 --> 00:07:33,642
Rename this script DestroyByContact

163
00:07:33,642 --> 00:07:35,283
and accept the changes to add this

164
00:07:35,283 --> 00:07:37,283
new script to Asteroid.

165
00:07:38,367 --> 00:07:39,858
File the script

166
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:42,519
and open it for editing.

167
00:07:45,502 --> 00:07:47,502
After removing the sample code

168
00:07:48,221 --> 00:07:50,221
let's write Trigger again and

169
00:07:50,221 --> 00:07:52,221
search the documentation.

170
00:07:53,349 --> 00:07:55,671
In this case we want to destroy the asteroid

171
00:07:55,671 --> 00:07:57,583
when the bolt first touches it

172
00:07:57,583 --> 00:08:00,270
so let's select OnTriggerEnter.

173
00:08:00,901 --> 00:08:02,680
This code is very much like the code

174
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,651
we used for our boundary.

175
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:06,651
except this code is called when a

176
00:08:06,651 --> 00:08:09,382
collider first touches the trigger collider

177
00:08:09,382 --> 00:08:11,382
rather than when the collider leaves the

178
00:08:11,382 --> 00:08:12,731
trigger volume.

179
00:08:13,751 --> 00:08:15,957
This sample code is also convenient

180
00:08:15,957 --> 00:08:18,416
as it does almost everything we need.

181
00:08:18,924 --> 00:08:21,483
When another collider enters the trigger

182
00:08:21,483 --> 00:08:24,013
we are given a reference to that other collider

183
00:08:24,013 --> 00:08:25,733
as Collider other.

184
00:08:26,233 --> 00:08:28,365
The code then destroys the other

185
00:08:28,365 --> 00:08:30,365
collider's game object.

186
00:08:30,953 --> 00:08:33,943
Copy this code and paste it in to our script.

187
00:08:34,867 --> 00:08:36,867
This code as it stands will destroy the

188
00:08:36,867 --> 00:08:39,352
laser bolt when it hits the asteroid.

189
00:08:40,448 --> 00:08:42,448
Next we need to destroy the asteroid

190
00:08:42,448 --> 00:08:46,039
itself with Destroy (gameObject).

191
00:08:46,933 --> 00:08:49,419
Destroy (gameObject) will destroy the game object

192
00:08:49,419 --> 00:08:51,608
this script is attached to

193
00:08:51,608 --> 00:08:53,741
which in this case is the asteroid

194
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:55,697
and all of it's children and all

195
00:08:55,697 --> 00:08:57,212
their attached components.

196
00:08:57,756 --> 00:09:00,065
One quick note about destroy.

197
00:09:00,065 --> 00:09:01,974
Destroy does not immediately destroy the

198
00:09:01,974 --> 00:09:04,606
object listed in the parenthesis.

199
00:09:04,606 --> 00:09:07,843
It marks the object to be destroyed

200
00:09:07,843 --> 00:09:09,843
and all of the marked objects are

201
00:09:09,843 --> 00:09:12,034
destroyed at the end of the frame.

202
00:09:12,034 --> 00:09:14,034
So we can put these destroy lines

203
00:09:14,034 --> 00:09:15,768
in any order.

204
00:09:15,768 --> 00:09:17,768
It seems wrong if we destroy this

205
00:09:17,768 --> 00:09:19,768
game object before we call destroy on

206
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:21,340
the other one.

207
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:23,340
But code-wise it doesn't matter what order

208
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:25,928
we mark our objects to be destroyed

209
00:09:25,928 --> 00:09:28,600
as long as they are marked in the same frame.

210
00:09:29,553 --> 00:09:32,523
Save this script and return to Unity.

211
00:09:33,353 --> 00:09:35,353
Again, this script has no properties

212
00:09:35,353 --> 00:09:37,163
for us to set in the Editor.

213
00:09:37,163 --> 00:09:39,163
It will just work as long as it's

214
00:09:39,163 --> 00:09:42,037
attached to an active game object.

215
00:09:42,037 --> 00:09:44,669
Let's save our scene and enter Play mode.

216
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:46,606
Where's our asteroid?

217
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:48,614
Let's exit Play mode.

218
00:09:49,114 --> 00:09:50,438
There it is.

219
00:09:51,278 --> 00:09:53,796
Okay, enter Play mode

220
00:09:53,796 --> 00:09:55,317
and it's gone!

221
00:09:55,317 --> 00:09:57,535
We can see our asteroid in Edit mode

222
00:09:57,535 --> 00:09:59,535
but it vanishes in Play mode.

223
00:10:00,035 --> 00:10:02,168
No, we aren't standing at a flux point

224
00:10:02,168 --> 00:10:04,862
in the probability field, we have a bug.

225
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:07,654
Let's do some simply debugging.

226
00:10:08,198 --> 00:10:09,816
Let's exit Play mode.

227
00:10:10,231 --> 00:10:12,791
We turn to our DestroyByContact script.

228
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,746
If something is calling our new trigger code

229
00:10:15,746 --> 00:10:17,895
and destroying our asteroid we need to

230
00:10:17,895 --> 00:10:20,468
find out what that something is.

231
00:10:21,461 --> 00:10:23,461
In OnTriggerEnter let's write

232
00:10:23,461 --> 00:10:27,054
debug.logOther.name

233
00:10:27,671 --> 00:10:29,671
This will send the name of the game object

234
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:31,510
that Other is attached to

235
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:33,510
as a line in our console log.

236
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:36,721
Save this script and return to Unity.

237
00:10:37,372 --> 00:10:38,858
Enter Play mode.

238
00:10:39,434 --> 00:10:41,753
and now we see who the culprit is,

239
00:10:41,753 --> 00:10:43,162
it's Boundary.

240
00:10:43,662 --> 00:10:45,387
We see the most recent error or message

241
00:10:45,387 --> 00:10:47,927
in the footer, we can also check the

242
00:10:47,927 --> 00:10:50,568
console for more detailed information.

243
00:10:51,727 --> 00:10:53,727
If we look in to the Hierarchy we can see

244
00:10:53,727 --> 00:10:55,727
that Boundary is also missing from

245
00:10:55,727 --> 00:10:58,214
our scene, it has been destroyed.

246
00:10:59,454 --> 00:11:02,027
Exit Play mode and switch to the Scene view.

247
00:11:02,655 --> 00:11:04,655
Now if we focus our Scene view camera

248
00:11:04,655 --> 00:11:06,873
on the Boundary we can look at

249
00:11:06,873 --> 00:11:09,914
the relationship between the asteroid and Boundary.

250
00:11:10,414 --> 00:11:13,299
Asteroid is right there in the middle of the boundary

251
00:11:13,716 --> 00:11:15,716
On the very first frame Asteroid

252
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:18,470
detects it's inside Boundary

253
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:20,844
and Boundary triggers our OnTriggerEnter

254
00:11:20,844 --> 00:11:23,596
code on Asteroid, and the code destroys

255
00:11:23,596 --> 00:11:26,441
both game objects in the very first frame.

256
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:29,314
We need to test our OnTriggerEnter

257
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:32,586
code and ignore collisions with Boundary.

258
00:11:33,086 --> 00:11:36,090
One way of identifying an object is with a tag.

259
00:11:36,687 --> 00:11:38,687
Let's tag our boundary.

260
00:11:39,187 --> 00:11:41,781
Select Boundary and in the header of

261
00:11:41,781 --> 00:11:43,781
the game object is it's tag.

262
00:11:44,281 --> 00:11:46,281
We can see it is untagged.

263
00:11:46,878 --> 00:11:50,564
Click on the Tag drop-down and select Add Tag.

264
00:11:51,216 --> 00:11:54,238
This brings up Tags and Layers in the Inspector.

265
00:11:54,917 --> 00:11:56,917
Our custom tag list is empty

266
00:11:56,917 --> 00:12:00,056
so let's add a new tag, Boundary.

267
00:12:00,646 --> 00:12:03,340
Now if we look back at our boundary game object

268
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:05,685
we can see it is still untagged.

269
00:12:06,116 --> 00:12:08,116
This is an important note.

270
00:12:08,116 --> 00:12:10,614
We used Add Tag on the Tag drop-down

271
00:12:10,614 --> 00:12:12,987
to create a new tag, but we still must

272
00:12:12,987 --> 00:12:14,987
assign that new tag.

273
00:12:14,987 --> 00:12:17,180
So with Boundary selected

274
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:20,840
click on the Tag drop-down and select Boundary.

275
00:12:21,962 --> 00:12:23,740
We now have successfully tagged this game

276
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:25,740
object as Boundary.

277
00:12:26,862 --> 00:12:30,009
Return to our DestroyByContact script.

278
00:12:30,009 --> 00:12:33,165
Let's remove our Debug line and replace it with

279
00:12:34,066 --> 00:12:36,794
If the other tag

280
00:12:36,794 --> 00:12:39,100
is the same as Boundary

281
00:12:39,724 --> 00:12:41,724
then return.

282
00:12:42,486 --> 00:12:44,887
Return ends the execution of a function

283
00:12:44,887 --> 00:12:46,702
and hands the control back to the

284
00:12:46,702 --> 00:12:49,340
function that called it, which in some cases

285
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:51,078
maybe Unity itself.

286
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:53,660
Optionally a value can be passed back

287
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:55,259
as well with return.

288
00:12:55,966 --> 00:12:57,966
In our case return simply ends this

289
00:12:57,966 --> 00:12:59,966
function at that point and returns the

290
00:12:59,966 --> 00:13:01,966
control back to Unity's game loop,

291
00:13:01,966 --> 00:13:04,311
which means we will never reach or execute

292
00:13:04,311 --> 00:13:06,311
the Destroy code if the other's

293
00:13:06,311 --> 00:13:08,311
tag is Boundary.

294
00:13:09,115 --> 00:13:11,115
Save the script and return to Unity.

295
00:13:12,748 --> 00:13:16,116
Enter Play mode and there's our asteroid.

296
00:13:16,116 --> 00:13:18,116
Fire our weapons and the asteroid

297
00:13:18,116 --> 00:13:20,558
and the laser bolt are destroyed.

298
00:13:21,127 --> 00:13:22,680
When the asteroid entered the boundary

299
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,680
on the first frame the trigger message

300
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:28,177
was cut short and the destruction code was ignored.

301
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:33,232
Now we have a tumbling asteroid and destruction code.

302
00:13:34,326 --> 00:13:36,602
In the next assignment we will add explosions,

303
00:13:36,602 --> 00:13:38,961
move the asteroid and save it as a prefab

304
00:13:38,961 --> 00:13:41,195
for our game controller to use.
