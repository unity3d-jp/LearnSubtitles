1
00:00:01,533 --> 00:00:04,019
Now we have shots for our player to shoot

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:06,791
so let's enable our player to shoot them.

3
00:00:06,791 --> 00:00:08,680
For this assignment we will need our

4
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:11,659
player game object, so select Player

5
00:00:11,659 --> 00:00:14,331
and reactivate the player game object.

6
00:00:15,513 --> 00:00:18,745
Next we need to edit our Player Controller script.

7
00:00:19,404 --> 00:00:21,061
There are several different ways that we can

8
00:00:21,061 --> 00:00:22,727
open a script for editing.

9
00:00:22,727 --> 00:00:25,185
In this case, with the player selected,

10
00:00:25,185 --> 00:00:27,185
use the context sensitive gear menu

11
00:00:27,185 --> 00:00:29,185
on the Player Controller component

12
00:00:29,185 --> 00:00:31,185
and selected Edit Script.

13
00:00:33,425 --> 00:00:35,936
This will open our script in our script editor.

14
00:00:36,754 --> 00:00:38,546
We want our player to shoot shots

15
00:00:38,546 --> 00:00:40,102
in to our scene.

16
00:00:40,102 --> 00:00:42,418
We have saved our shots as a prefab

17
00:00:42,418 --> 00:00:44,611
game object in our project.

18
00:00:44,611 --> 00:00:46,611
This is an asset that we can use

19
00:00:46,611 --> 00:00:48,110
when our game is running.

20
00:00:48,697 --> 00:00:51,292
What we need to do is instantiate

21
00:00:51,292 --> 00:00:53,793
a copy of clone of this Shot prefab

22
00:00:53,793 --> 00:00:55,793
when we hit a button or click a mouse

23
00:00:55,793 --> 00:00:57,793
during our game play.

24
00:00:58,665 --> 00:01:00,597
Where are we going to write this code?

25
00:01:00,945 --> 00:01:03,373
Well, simply getting input from a button

26
00:01:03,373 --> 00:01:05,221
doesn't require physics,

27
00:01:05,221 --> 00:01:07,221
and we don't want to wait for a fixed update

28
00:01:07,221 --> 00:01:08,943
to fire our weapon.

29
00:01:09,514 --> 00:01:12,390
So let's put our code in the Update function.

30
00:01:13,111 --> 00:01:15,720
Write void Update.

31
00:01:17,753 --> 00:01:20,478
Unity will execute all of the code in Update

32
00:01:20,478 --> 00:01:23,783
just before updating the frame, every frame.

33
00:01:24,978 --> 00:01:28,320
Now we want to instantiate our shot.

34
00:01:29,151 --> 00:01:30,862
How do we use instantiate?

35
00:01:30,862 --> 00:01:33,318
Well, let's check the documentation.

36
00:01:33,997 --> 00:01:35,997
The shortcut to Unity's scripting reference

37
00:01:35,997 --> 00:01:40,560
in the documentation is command+' on the Mac

38
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,658
and control+' on Windows.

39
00:01:46,133 --> 00:01:49,577
And choose Object Instantiate.

40
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:53,282
For more detailed information on instantiate

41
00:01:53,282 --> 00:01:55,658
please see the lesson linked below.

42
00:01:56,362 --> 00:01:59,592
Instantiate needs an object to instantiate

43
00:01:59,592 --> 00:02:01,983
and a position and rotation to set 

44
00:02:01,983 --> 00:02:03,983
the object to when it is instantiated

45
00:02:03,983 --> 00:02:05,983
in the scene.

46
00:02:07,008 --> 00:02:12,097
So let's write object, position, rotation.

47
00:02:14,116 --> 00:02:16,885
We know what object we want to instantiate,

48
00:02:17,661 --> 00:02:19,661
that's our Bolt prefab.

49
00:02:22,385 --> 00:02:24,385
Where, on the other hand, will we find

50
00:02:24,385 --> 00:02:27,633
a position which is a vector3

51
00:02:27,633 --> 00:02:30,416
and a rotation, which is a quaternion

52
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:33,878
to set our object to when it is instantiated?

53
00:02:34,584 --> 00:02:37,003
There is one compact package where we can find

54
00:02:37,003 --> 00:02:40,229
both a position and a rotation

55
00:02:40,729 --> 00:02:43,876
and that is in a game object's transform.

56
00:02:45,923 --> 00:02:47,923
The transform component contains

57
00:02:47,923 --> 00:02:50,090
a position as a vector3

58
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:52,711
and a rotation as a quaternion.

59
00:02:53,211 --> 00:02:55,976
The transform also includes a scale

60
00:02:55,976 --> 00:02:57,976
as a vector3, which we can ignore

61
00:02:57,976 --> 00:02:59,976
for instantiate.

62
00:03:00,476 --> 00:03:02,709
In the Inspector the quaternion

63
00:03:02,709 --> 00:03:07,445
for rotation is simplified as a quaternion euler.

64
00:03:08,718 --> 00:03:10,718
For more information on quaternions and 

65
00:03:10,718 --> 00:03:14,473
quaternion euler please see the lesson linked below.

66
00:03:15,346 --> 00:03:18,358
So how do we use this to instantiate a shot?

67
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:21,010
Create a new empty game object.

68
00:03:21,441 --> 00:03:23,441
Rename it Shot Spawn.

69
00:03:24,756 --> 00:03:27,571
We can use this empty game object's transform

70
00:03:27,571 --> 00:03:29,571
as a spawn point in our game.

71
00:03:30,002 --> 00:03:32,002
We can think of this as some sort of

72
00:03:32,002 --> 00:03:35,063
virtual hard point to attach our weapons to.

73
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:38,941
This spawn point should move with our player ship.

74
00:03:39,441 --> 00:03:41,608
So let's drag Shot Spawn

75
00:03:41,608 --> 00:03:43,304
on to our player game object

76
00:03:43,304 --> 00:03:45,304
and drop it as a child.

77
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:48,535
If we open the player game object family

78
00:03:48,535 --> 00:03:50,975
we can see the Shot Spawn in the Hierarchy

79
00:03:50,975 --> 00:03:52,975
as a child game object.

80
00:03:54,649 --> 00:03:56,649
Let's switch to the Scene view for a

81
00:03:56,649 --> 00:03:58,551
good look at our player ship

82
00:03:58,551 --> 00:04:01,010
and the Shot Spawn game object.

83
00:04:02,253 --> 00:04:04,253
We can now position the Shot Spawn.

84
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,323
As it's a child of the player ship

85
00:04:07,323 --> 00:04:09,323
our Shot Spawn's position will

86
00:04:09,323 --> 00:04:11,323
be relative to the player ship.

87
00:04:12,403 --> 00:04:14,195
We want to instantiate our shots in

88
00:04:14,195 --> 00:04:15,986
front of the player ship

89
00:04:15,986 --> 00:04:18,951
so let's drag the Shot Spawn out along it's

90
00:04:18,951 --> 00:04:21,814
Z axis until it's in front of the ship.

91
00:04:23,502 --> 00:04:26,667
Let's make this a round 1.25.

92
00:04:27,581 --> 00:04:29,803
If we want to test the position

93
00:04:29,803 --> 00:04:33,197
we can drag an instance of our Bolt prefab

94
00:04:33,197 --> 00:04:35,859
in to the scene as a child of Shot Spawn.

95
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:40,358
Make sure the instance's transform is at origin.

96
00:04:40,358 --> 00:04:42,957
This is a local value, so it will be

97
00:04:42,957 --> 00:04:46,494
at origin relative to the Shot Spawn's transform.

98
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,560
This is where the Shot Spawn's position and

99
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,061
rotation will put our instances.

100
00:04:52,061 --> 00:04:55,310
That's great, that feels good to me.

101
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:57,810
Now, let's make sure we delete our

102
00:04:57,810 --> 00:04:59,810
test instance, we don't want to have a

103
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:02,320
shot in our scene when we start the game.

104
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:06,621
Let's return to our player controller script.

105
00:05:08,088 --> 00:05:10,462
Now we need to write a few variables to hold

106
00:05:10,462 --> 00:05:13,543
references to our object and transform.

107
00:05:14,043 --> 00:05:17,862
Write public GameObject shot

108
00:05:17,862 --> 00:05:21,886
and public GameObject shotSpawn.

109
00:05:22,386 --> 00:05:23,669
Hmmm.

110
00:05:23,669 --> 00:05:26,343
There may be a better way to handle Shot Spawn.

111
00:05:26,843 --> 00:05:29,567
If we reference the game object to get the

112
00:05:29,567 --> 00:05:31,732
position and rotation we need

113
00:05:31,732 --> 00:05:36,883
we would have to write shotSpawn.transform.position

114
00:05:36,883 --> 00:05:38,883
and the same for rotation.

115
00:05:39,383 --> 00:05:41,631
On the other hand our variable

116
00:05:41,631 --> 00:05:43,853
could use the type of transform

117
00:05:43,853 --> 00:05:45,853
instead of game object.

118
00:05:45,853 --> 00:05:47,853
We will still drag a reference using the game

119
00:05:47,853 --> 00:05:50,047
object in the Inspector

120
00:05:50,047 --> 00:05:52,047
but Unity is smart enough to find

121
00:05:52,047 --> 00:05:54,047
and use the transform component on that

122
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:56,047
game object if we declare the

123
00:05:56,047 --> 00:05:58,931
variable's type as transform.

124
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,840
So what do we want to instantiate?

125
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:04,610
Our shot.

126
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:06,610
And where do we want to instantiate it?

127
00:06:07,386 --> 00:06:10,203
At the Shot Spawn position

128
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:12,994
with the Shot Spawn rotation applied.

129
00:06:15,138 --> 00:06:17,704
If we left the code like this and tested it

130
00:06:17,704 --> 00:06:20,370
we would create a stream of shots.

131
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:22,370
One new shot every frame.

132
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:25,796
For this game let's fire a shot

133
00:06:25,796 --> 00:06:28,666
only when the player holds down a fire button.

134
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:31,025
And we will limit the fire rate as well

135
00:06:31,025 --> 00:06:33,444
to a value we can set in the editor.

136
00:06:34,326 --> 00:06:37,354
We do this with Input.GetButton.

137
00:06:38,945 --> 00:06:42,250
Let's look up Input.GetButton in the documentation.

138
00:06:46,866 --> 00:06:48,866
Conveniently the code snippet in

139
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:50,866
the documentation is all about 

140
00:06:50,866 --> 00:06:53,791
firing a weapon and limiting the fire rate.

141
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:57,431
Let's step through this code one line at a time.

142
00:06:57,931 --> 00:07:00,943
The example starts with a game object reference,

143
00:07:00,943 --> 00:07:02,943
like our Shot reference,

144
00:07:02,943 --> 00:07:06,756
followed by a float value to set the fireRate,

145
00:07:06,756 --> 00:07:09,691
or how long we must wait between shots.

146
00:07:10,246 --> 00:07:13,464
Lastly there is a nextFire value

147
00:07:13,464 --> 00:07:15,812
which is used to track when in the game

148
00:07:15,812 --> 00:07:18,145
we can fire our next shot.

149
00:07:19,044 --> 00:07:21,737
Let's look at the code in Update.

150
00:07:22,955 --> 00:07:25,304
We only execute the instantiate code

151
00:07:25,304 --> 00:07:27,526
and fire a shot if

152
00:07:27,526 --> 00:07:29,526
Input.GetButton is true

153
00:07:29,526 --> 00:07:32,231
and the time in the game is greater

154
00:07:32,231 --> 00:07:34,231
than our nextFire value.

155
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:39,626
The Fire1 used in the Input.GetButton code

156
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:42,828
is a value preset in the input manager,

157
00:07:42,828 --> 00:07:45,637
and the time in the game is represented by

158
00:07:45,637 --> 00:07:47,637
Time.time.

159
00:07:47,637 --> 00:07:49,818
For more information on the input manager

160
00:07:49,818 --> 00:07:51,818
or the time class please see the lessons

161
00:07:51,818 --> 00:07:53,818
linked below.

162
00:07:54,318 --> 00:07:56,499
What is the key to this code is that

163
00:07:56,499 --> 00:07:59,108
as soon as the If statement returns true

164
00:07:59,108 --> 00:08:01,426
for both the Input.GetButton

165
00:08:01,426 --> 00:08:03,536
and Time.time

166
00:08:03,536 --> 00:08:05,941
the nextFire rate is updated,

167
00:08:05,941 --> 00:08:08,373
which prevents us from firing again.

168
00:08:09,163 --> 00:08:10,912
All of the code in Update will be

169
00:08:10,912 --> 00:08:12,912
executed every frame.

170
00:08:12,912 --> 00:08:15,299
On the very first frame Time.time

171
00:08:15,299 --> 00:08:17,299
will be greater than 0

172
00:08:17,299 --> 00:08:20,610
so we could fire as soon as we touch the fire button.

173
00:08:21,414 --> 00:08:23,414
But let's say we don't touch the button until

174
00:08:23,414 --> 00:08:25,414
1 second in to the game.

175
00:08:25,734 --> 00:08:28,532
On every frame before that 1 second mark

176
00:08:28,532 --> 00:08:30,532
Time.time will never be tested

177
00:08:30,532 --> 00:08:34,723
against nextFire as Input.GetButton Fire1

178
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:36,001
Fire1 will be false

179
00:08:36,001 --> 00:08:39,246
and this statement is tested from left to right.

180
00:08:40,229 --> 00:08:42,103
When we do touch the fire button

181
00:08:42,103 --> 00:08:44,900
Input.GetButton Fire1 will be true

182
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,900
and Time.time at 1 second

183
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:50,599
will be greater than the nextFire value of 0.

184
00:08:50,599 --> 00:08:53,126
So we fire our first shot.

185
00:08:53,126 --> 00:08:55,224
However, in the same frame

186
00:08:55,224 --> 00:08:57,818
we increase the value of nextFire

187
00:08:57,818 --> 00:09:00,577
to Time.time plus fireRate.

188
00:09:00,577 --> 00:09:04,617
or 1 second plus 0.5.

189
00:09:05,062 --> 00:09:08,317
NextFire is now 1.5.

190
00:09:08,858 --> 00:09:11,343
If we keep our finger on the fire button

191
00:09:11,343 --> 00:09:14,077
in the next few frames Input.GetButton

192
00:09:14,077 --> 00:09:16,517
will be true but Time.time

193
00:09:16,517 --> 00:09:18,947
won't be greater than nextFire.

194
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:22,069
We won't be able to shoot another shot

195
00:09:22,069 --> 00:09:26,083
until more than 1.5 seconds in to the game.

196
00:09:27,508 --> 00:09:29,992
So let's copy the sample code

197
00:09:29,992 --> 00:09:32,827
from the documentation and paste it in to our script.

198
00:09:33,672 --> 00:09:35,840
There is 1 typo in this C# code

199
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,978
snippet that we need to correct.

200
00:09:37,978 --> 00:09:42,198
We only need as GameObject once in our code.

201
00:09:43,817 --> 00:09:46,472
What is this as GameObject code for?

202
00:09:47,511 --> 00:09:49,511
We need to remember that we are simply

203
00:09:49,511 --> 00:09:52,502
instantiating a basic object with our code.

204
00:09:53,002 --> 00:09:55,002
Unity does not know what type of

205
00:09:55,002 --> 00:09:56,722
object this is.

206
00:09:56,722 --> 00:09:58,722
We could have defined this object in a

207
00:09:58,722 --> 00:10:00,363
number of different types.

208
00:10:01,015 --> 00:10:03,084
To access and use this object

209
00:10:03,084 --> 00:10:05,084
we need to tell Unity what type of

210
00:10:05,084 --> 00:10:06,876
object it is.

211
00:10:06,876 --> 00:10:09,911
So what we are saying with this line of code is

212
00:10:09,911 --> 00:10:12,813
please, instantiate this basic object

213
00:10:12,813 --> 00:10:14,813
as a game object.

214
00:10:16,086 --> 00:10:18,323
When we instantiate an object we can take

215
00:10:18,323 --> 00:10:20,323
a reference to that game object.

216
00:10:21,182 --> 00:10:23,512
The instantiate function will return

217
00:10:23,512 --> 00:10:25,691
or give us a reference to the object

218
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:27,691
we are instantiating.

219
00:10:27,691 --> 00:10:30,145
We take that reference here with our

220
00:10:30,145 --> 00:10:33,063
game object variable at the beginning of the line.

221
00:10:33,985 --> 00:10:36,527
This gives us a connection to the new object

222
00:10:36,527 --> 00:10:38,265
as a game object,

223
00:10:38,265 --> 00:10:40,775
otherwise the new object just gets dropped

224
00:10:40,775 --> 00:10:42,775
in to our scene along with all of the other

225
00:10:42,775 --> 00:10:44,416
objects that we have.

226
00:10:44,971 --> 00:10:47,237
Without a reference to the new object

227
00:10:47,237 --> 00:10:49,237
we cannot easily find and pick this

228
00:10:49,237 --> 00:10:52,251
object out of all of the others in the scene.

229
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:55,182
If we don't have a connection or a reference

230
00:10:55,182 --> 00:10:58,655
to a specific object we cannot perform actions

231
00:10:58,655 --> 00:11:01,315
or do things with this object.

232
00:11:01,315 --> 00:11:03,120
If we take the reference to the new object

233
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,120
when we instantiate it we now have

234
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,120
access to that new object.

235
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:10,090
Now in our case we are simply

236
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:12,535
firing our shots in to the scene.

237
00:11:12,535 --> 00:11:14,535
We don't need to do anything

238
00:11:14,535 --> 00:11:17,175
with these shots once we have fired them.

239
00:11:17,175 --> 00:11:19,438
They can take care of themselves.

240
00:11:19,438 --> 00:11:22,307
We don't need a reference to the shots we fire

241
00:11:22,307 --> 00:11:24,307
and we can get rid of the reference

242
00:11:24,307 --> 00:11:26,569
and simply instantiate the object.

243
00:11:27,028 --> 00:11:29,768
When we do we must also get rid of the

244
00:11:29,768 --> 00:11:31,768
as GameObject as well.

245
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:35,276
Now let's update the sample code we've

246
00:11:35,276 --> 00:11:37,276
pasted in to our script.

247
00:11:37,997 --> 00:11:40,720
We want to instantiate our shot

248
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,956
at the Shot Spawn position

249
00:11:42,956 --> 00:11:45,414
with the Shot Spawn rotation.

250
00:11:46,176 --> 00:11:48,176
Next we need to update our variables

251
00:11:48,176 --> 00:11:50,176
to work with this code.

252
00:11:50,176 --> 00:11:53,965
We need a public float for our fireRate

253
00:11:53,965 --> 00:11:57,263
and a private float for our nextFire.

254
00:11:58,737 --> 00:12:02,061
Now let's save this script and return to Unity.

255
00:12:02,957 --> 00:12:06,091
Click on the player game object so we can inspect it.

256
00:12:06,926 --> 00:12:08,926
We need to populate the references we have

257
00:12:08,926 --> 00:12:11,752
created in our Player Controller script.

258
00:12:11,752 --> 00:12:13,752
Open the Prefabs folder and drag the

259
00:12:13,752 --> 00:12:16,503
Bolt prefab on to Shot.

260
00:12:18,321 --> 00:12:20,779
Next grab the Shot Spawn game object

261
00:12:20,779 --> 00:12:23,220
from the Hierarchy and drag it on to the

262
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:25,076
Shot Spawn reference on the

263
00:12:25,076 --> 00:12:27,076
player controller component.

264
00:12:28,078 --> 00:12:30,078
Note that Unity was able to reference

265
00:12:30,078 --> 00:12:31,667
the transform component from the

266
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:33,667
Shot Spawn game object.

267
00:12:34,441 --> 00:12:37,367
Lastly we need to set our fireRate.

268
00:12:37,367 --> 00:12:40,554
4 times a second sounds good and fast,

269
00:12:40,554 --> 00:12:43,711
so let's use 0.25.

270
00:12:44,667 --> 00:12:47,349
Now let's save and play.

271
00:12:49,081 --> 00:12:51,081
And we're shooting our shots.

272
00:12:52,844 --> 00:12:55,634
And as we move, because the Shot Spawn

273
00:12:55,634 --> 00:12:57,634
is a child of our player ship,

274
00:12:57,634 --> 00:12:59,788
we always shoot from the front of the ship,

275
00:12:59,788 --> 00:13:02,259
no matter where we are in the game.

276
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:06,313
Our player can now shoot shots.

277
00:13:07,437 --> 00:13:09,437
We have created a problem however

278
00:13:09,437 --> 00:13:11,560
we are filling our scene with shot

279
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:14,692
game object clones, all flying off to infinity

280
00:13:14,692 --> 00:13:16,399
on the Z axis.

281
00:13:16,899 --> 00:13:19,622
In the next assignment we will create a boundary

282
00:13:19,622 --> 00:13:21,192
to clean up any game objects

283
00:13:21,192 --> 00:13:23,192
that leave the game area.
