1
00:00:01,602 --> 00:00:03,666
Now that we can destroy our hazards

2
00:00:03,666 --> 00:00:06,413
we should reward our player with points.

3
00:00:06,413 --> 00:00:08,413
Let's count and display a score

4
00:00:08,413 --> 00:00:10,721
where every asteroid hazard destroyed

5
00:00:10,721 --> 00:00:12,804
gives our player 10 points.

6
00:00:12,804 --> 00:00:15,623
We will start by creating a display for the score

7
00:00:15,623 --> 00:00:18,676
before we create a score value to feed it with.

8
00:00:19,342 --> 00:00:21,649
First using the Create menu

9
00:00:21,649 --> 00:00:24,992
in the Hierarchy view select GUI Text.

10
00:00:26,307 --> 00:00:28,307
This creates a new game object with

11
00:00:28,307 --> 00:00:30,307
a GUI text component attached.

12
00:00:31,194 --> 00:00:34,296
Rename this game object Score Text.

13
00:00:35,942 --> 00:00:37,942
We can now see GUI text being

14
00:00:37,942 --> 00:00:40,467
displayed in the centre of our game area.

15
00:00:40,967 --> 00:00:43,874
The Text property on the GUI text component

16
00:00:43,874 --> 00:00:45,694
drives what is being displayed.

17
00:00:46,222 --> 00:00:48,470
The rest of the component describes

18
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:50,927
how this text is displayed and where this

19
00:00:50,927 --> 00:00:53,221
text is displayed on screen.

20
00:00:54,532 --> 00:00:56,532
We will not go in to all of the details

21
00:00:56,532 --> 00:00:58,532
of the GUI text component.

22
00:00:58,532 --> 00:01:00,879
For more information on GUI text

23
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:03,195
see the details linked below.

24
00:01:05,133 --> 00:01:07,133
In later assignments we will create

25
00:01:07,133 --> 00:01:09,133
additional GUI text objects

26
00:01:09,133 --> 00:01:11,008
to hold different information.

27
00:01:11,523 --> 00:01:13,979
With the default GUI text in the Text property

28
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:16,586
on all of them the Game View at edit time

29
00:01:16,586 --> 00:01:18,586
could become a little confusing.

30
00:01:19,417 --> 00:01:22,810
Change the Text property to Score Text.

31
00:01:23,393 --> 00:01:25,393
We can see Score Text is now being

32
00:01:25,393 --> 00:01:27,393
displayed in the Game View.

33
00:01:27,893 --> 00:01:30,745
We will be changing this value at runtime.

34
00:01:31,245 --> 00:01:33,245
Changing this label now will help

35
00:01:33,245 --> 00:01:36,703
us identify which display is which while editing.

36
00:01:37,921 --> 00:01:39,921
Our Score Text is currently displaying

37
00:01:39,921 --> 00:01:41,921
in the middle of our screen.

38
00:01:42,766 --> 00:01:44,626
Let's move it so it displayed in the upper

39
00:01:44,626 --> 00:01:46,626
left of the game screen.

40
00:01:47,126 --> 00:01:49,126
Before we change any settings

41
00:01:49,126 --> 00:01:51,126
it's important to understand

42
00:01:51,126 --> 00:01:53,703
that GUI text is drawn on a layer

43
00:01:53,703 --> 00:01:56,662
above our game, not in the game world.

44
00:01:57,438 --> 00:01:59,841
We won't see it in our Scene view.

45
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:02,861
Moreover it is important to understand

46
00:02:02,861 --> 00:02:05,413
that the GUI text uses something called

47
00:02:05,413 --> 00:02:09,023
Viewport Space, rather than screen space.

48
00:02:09,689 --> 00:02:11,689
The difference, very briefly,

49
00:02:11,689 --> 00:02:15,363
is that screen space is defined in pixels.

50
00:02:15,363 --> 00:02:17,363
This is the number of pixels wide

51
00:02:17,363 --> 00:02:20,434
and high that we set in our player settings.

52
00:02:23,883 --> 00:02:26,424
Viewport Space is defined simply

53
00:02:26,424 --> 00:02:29,034
as a single width and height value

54
00:02:29,034 --> 00:02:31,282
with (0 0) in the lower left

55
00:02:31,282 --> 00:02:33,748
and (1,1) in the upper right.

56
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:38,030
With Viewport Space in mind

57
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:41,781
set the transform position on the display text

58
00:02:41,781 --> 00:02:46,493
from (0.5, 0.5) on the X and Y,

59
00:02:46,493 --> 00:02:49,029
in other words the middle of the screen,

60
00:02:49,847 --> 00:02:52,714
to (0, 1), which is the upper left.

61
00:02:54,443 --> 00:02:56,443
The text seems wedged up against

62
00:02:56,443 --> 00:02:58,292
the upper left corner.

63
00:02:58,292 --> 00:03:00,209
It would be good to give it some pad

64
00:03:00,209 --> 00:03:02,442
or space around it to separate

65
00:03:02,442 --> 00:03:04,442
it from the edges of the game screen.

66
00:03:05,881 --> 00:03:07,881
Because of the viewport space

67
00:03:07,881 --> 00:03:10,518
it is awkward trying to set such a small

68
00:03:10,518 --> 00:03:13,938
value of space using the transform component.

69
00:03:14,894 --> 00:03:18,165
This solution to this is to use pixel offset.

70
00:03:18,692 --> 00:03:21,572
Pixel offset is, not too surprisingly,

71
00:03:21,572 --> 00:03:23,240
using pixels.

72
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,587
So we can set our primary location

73
00:03:25,587 --> 00:03:27,587
with the transform component,

74
00:03:27,587 --> 00:03:29,365
the upper left corner,

75
00:03:29,365 --> 00:03:32,102
and then perfect it with pixel offset.

76
00:03:32,708 --> 00:03:37,114
Change Pixel Offset to 10 and -10.

77
00:03:37,114 --> 00:03:39,279
This will give us a 10 pixel

78
00:03:39,279 --> 00:03:41,279
pad around our score text.

79
00:03:41,779 --> 00:03:43,971
Separating it from the edge of the screen.

80
00:03:45,066 --> 00:03:47,437
Next we need to feed Score Text

81
00:03:47,437 --> 00:03:49,064
a score value.

82
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:52,471
Select Game Controller and open the

83
00:03:52,471 --> 00:03:54,996
GameController script for editing.

84
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:59,656
The first thing we need is a

85
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:04,799
public GUI Text variable called scoreText

86
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,904
to hold a reference to our GUI text component.

87
00:04:08,722 --> 00:04:10,792
The next thing we need is a

88
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:14,439
public int variable called score

89
00:04:14,439 --> 00:04:16,439
to hold our current score.

90
00:04:17,381 --> 00:04:19,983
We use int because we will never count

91
00:04:19,983 --> 00:04:21,649
a partial point.

92
00:04:21,649 --> 00:04:24,713
Score will always be a whole number.

93
00:04:25,847 --> 00:04:27,847
Our game controller will keep track

94
00:04:27,847 --> 00:04:31,381
of our score, increment it when we destroy hazards

95
00:04:31,381 --> 00:04:34,588
and feed that value to our score text.

96
00:04:36,842 --> 00:04:40,482
To update our score we need to write a new function.

97
00:04:40,982 --> 00:04:44,390
Write void update score.

98
00:04:45,194 --> 00:04:47,933
And the code within this function is

99
00:04:47,933 --> 00:04:56,189
scoreText.text = "score: " +score.

100
00:04:57,877 --> 00:05:00,476
This function will set the text property

101
00:05:00,476 --> 00:05:02,737
on the Score Text component

102
00:05:02,737 --> 00:05:07,719
to the string Score: plus whatever our 

103
00:05:07,719 --> 00:05:11,438
current score value is held by our score variable.

104
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:14,784
When written like this Unity automatically

105
00:05:14,784 --> 00:05:17,629
converts the int value of Score

106
00:05:17,629 --> 00:05:19,629
to a string of text characters

107
00:05:19,629 --> 00:05:22,499
so it works with our text property.

108
00:05:23,275 --> 00:05:25,275
This feeds our score value

109
00:05:25,275 --> 00:05:27,275
to our GUI text component.

110
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,872
We next need to update our score

111
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:32,598
in two different places.

112
00:05:33,068 --> 00:05:35,261
When we first start the game

113
00:05:35,261 --> 00:05:37,261
and when a hazard is destroyed.

114
00:05:38,728 --> 00:05:40,907
When we start the game the first thing we need

115
00:05:40,907 --> 00:05:44,876
to do is set our score to 0.

116
00:05:45,777 --> 00:05:48,148
Then we want to call update Score

117
00:05:48,148 --> 00:05:51,496
to set the score text to this starting value.

118
00:05:53,046 --> 00:05:57,490
Now how can we tell from inside Game Controller

119
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:00,121
when a hazard has been destroyed by the player?

120
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:02,460
Well, we can't.

121
00:06:03,153 --> 00:06:06,351
But we can expose a public function

122
00:06:06,351 --> 00:06:08,908
to the other game objects in our game

123
00:06:08,908 --> 00:06:11,089
like the hazards themselves

124
00:06:11,089 --> 00:06:13,520
and when they are destroyed the hazards

125
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,521
can inform Game Controller to add to the score,

126
00:06:17,521 --> 00:06:20,523
and the Game Controller can use this information

127
00:06:20,523 --> 00:06:23,479
as a signal to update the score text.

128
00:06:24,794 --> 00:06:28,154
Let's create a public function for our hazards.

129
00:06:28,571 --> 00:06:32,040
Write public void AddScore

130
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:36,208
with the parameter int newScoreValue.

131
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:41,359
First we write code to update our score value

132
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:45,938
with score += newScoreValue.

133
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:49,352
And then we call the function UpdateScore

134
00:06:49,352 --> 00:06:51,352
to update our score text to display

135
00:06:51,352 --> 00:06:53,491
the new current score.

136
00:06:55,469 --> 00:06:57,622
We now need to call Add Score

137
00:06:57,622 --> 00:07:00,538
from our game when a hazard is destroyed.

138
00:07:00,538 --> 00:07:03,697
Save this script and switch back to Unity.

139
00:07:05,426 --> 00:07:07,883
Let's look at our asteroid hazards

140
00:07:09,032 --> 00:07:11,490
We want our instances of this prefab

141
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:14,448
to call addScore on GameController

142
00:07:14,448 --> 00:07:16,865
when they are destroyed by the player.

143
00:07:17,487 --> 00:07:20,153
The player destroys our hazards through the

144
00:07:20,153 --> 00:07:22,153
DestroyByContact script.

145
00:07:22,819 --> 00:07:26,412
So open DestroyByContact for editing.

146
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,756
First let's give our hazards a value

147
00:07:31,756 --> 00:07:34,763
with public int scoreValue.

148
00:07:36,133 --> 00:07:38,328
Now how do we call a function

149
00:07:38,328 --> 00:07:41,008
on another component on a different game object?

150
00:07:41,991 --> 00:07:44,502
We can try to access this by writing

151
00:07:44,502 --> 00:07:47,363
GameController.AddScore

152
00:07:47,863 --> 00:07:50,668
and then send the new score value

153
00:07:50,668 --> 00:07:53,178
with the argument scoreValue.

154
00:07:53,983 --> 00:07:56,577
Save this script and return to Unity.

155
00:07:58,127 --> 00:08:00,389
Well we seem to have an error.

156
00:08:00,972 --> 00:08:04,023
We can see the most recent error in the footer.

157
00:08:04,023 --> 00:08:06,023
Let's open the console and look at this

158
00:08:06,023 --> 00:08:07,578
error more closely.

159
00:08:08,854 --> 00:08:10,950
The error seems to be on the script

160
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:13,678
we have just edited, not surprisingly,

161
00:08:13,678 --> 00:08:15,678
the DestroyByContact script.

162
00:08:16,302 --> 00:08:18,205
This error says

163
00:08:18,205 --> 00:08:20,819
an object reference is required to access

164
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:25,073
non-static member GameController.AddScore(int).

165
00:08:25,761 --> 00:08:27,497
Why is this?

166
00:08:27,497 --> 00:08:29,636
This is because we are addressing the

167
00:08:29,636 --> 00:08:32,328
class directly, not a specific

168
00:08:32,328 --> 00:08:34,136
instance of our class.

169
00:08:34,787 --> 00:08:37,075
If we look at our Game Controller object

170
00:08:37,075 --> 00:08:38,909
we can see that there is a GameController

171
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:40,909
script attached.

172
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:44,632
This is an instance of this script or class.

173
00:08:44,632 --> 00:08:47,097
This is very much like all of the asteroid

174
00:08:47,097 --> 00:08:49,097
hazards or laser bolts that we have

175
00:08:49,097 --> 00:08:51,097
instantiated in our scene.

176
00:08:51,097 --> 00:08:53,251
Each one is an instance.

177
00:08:53,251 --> 00:08:55,473
Even though we have one and only one

178
00:08:55,473 --> 00:08:57,861
GameController script in our game

179
00:08:57,861 --> 00:08:59,861
there is nothing technically stopping us

180
00:08:59,861 --> 00:09:01,484
from having several.

181
00:09:02,085 --> 00:09:04,598
If we created a new game object,

182
00:09:04,598 --> 00:09:06,598
say a cube, there is nothing stopping

183
00:09:06,598 --> 00:09:08,598
us from having another instance of

184
00:09:08,598 --> 00:09:10,598
GameController on it.

185
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:13,333
Now we have two instances of our

186
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:14,961
GameController script.

187
00:09:15,584 --> 00:09:17,584
When our hazard is destroyed it needs to know

188
00:09:17,584 --> 00:09:20,188
which one to call AddScore on.

189
00:09:20,871 --> 00:09:23,641
This is very much like valet parking.

190
00:09:24,086 --> 00:09:25,592
We can't simply say

191
00:09:25,592 --> 00:09:27,799
'please, can you bring our car?'.

192
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:30,501
We must have a reference to a specific car,

193
00:09:30,501 --> 00:09:32,501
usually through a numbered ticket

194
00:09:32,501 --> 00:09:35,050
so the valet knows which one to bring.

195
00:09:36,244 --> 00:09:38,866
Let's delete our example cube.

196
00:09:41,341 --> 00:09:44,028
Even though we have only one instance

197
00:09:44,028 --> 00:09:46,182
we still need a reference to it.

198
00:09:46,182 --> 00:09:48,881
That valet won't bring our car without a ticket,

199
00:09:48,881 --> 00:09:51,172
even if it's the only one on the lot.

200
00:09:53,053 --> 00:09:56,315
Reopen DestroyByContact for editing.

201
00:09:58,108 --> 00:10:00,108
Let's write a variable to hold our

202
00:10:00,108 --> 00:10:03,458
reference to our instance of GameController.

203
00:10:04,842 --> 00:10:08,788
Write public GameController gameController

204
00:10:09,288 --> 00:10:12,330
Note the 2 different capitalisation's.

205
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:14,675
The first Game Controller with a capital G

206
00:10:14,675 --> 00:10:17,066
is the class name, or type.

207
00:10:17,714 --> 00:10:20,638
The second Game Controller with the lower case g

208
00:10:20,638 --> 00:10:22,638
is the name of our variable.

209
00:10:23,442 --> 00:10:25,442
Now if we copy and paste the

210
00:10:25,442 --> 00:10:27,442
name of our variable in to the

211
00:10:27,442 --> 00:10:30,891
offending line of code we change the line from

212
00:10:30,891 --> 00:10:33,140
addressing the class directly

213
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:35,769
to using the reference to our instance

214
00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:37,769
that we have held in our variable.

215
00:10:39,526 --> 00:10:42,175
Save this script and return to Unity.

216
00:10:43,421 --> 00:10:45,421
And the error is gone.

217
00:10:46,764 --> 00:10:48,764
Let's switch to the Game View.

218
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,880
Select the Asteroid prefab.

219
00:10:53,532 --> 00:10:55,615
We can now see the Game Controller

220
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:59,550
type reference on the DestroyByContact component.

221
00:10:59,843 --> 00:11:01,843
We need to associate our instance of

222
00:11:01,843 --> 00:11:03,843
GameController with this variable.

223
00:11:04,744 --> 00:11:07,247
So let's drag our GameController object

224
00:11:07,247 --> 00:11:09,929
on to the slot to make the reference.

225
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,760
Okay, that doesn't work.

226
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:15,761
Let's try to use the asset picker.

227
00:11:16,962 --> 00:11:17,763
Nope.

228
00:11:18,252 --> 00:11:19,919
This is not working.

229
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:21,177
Why?

230
00:11:22,695 --> 00:11:25,936
This comes back to the nature of instances.

231
00:11:25,936 --> 00:11:29,529
Instances are copies of objects within a scene.

232
00:11:30,029 --> 00:11:33,421
Now if we think about the nature of prefabs,

233
00:11:33,421 --> 00:11:36,160
prefabs are templates of game objects

234
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,698
that can be instantiated in any scene in our game.

235
00:11:40,101 --> 00:11:42,101
It doesn't make sense that a template

236
00:11:42,101 --> 00:11:44,584
that can be added to any scene in our game

237
00:11:44,584 --> 00:11:46,891
can hold a reference to an instance

238
00:11:46,891 --> 00:11:48,891
in just one scene.

239
00:11:49,971 --> 00:11:51,971
Now once we have instantiated our

240
00:11:51,971 --> 00:11:53,748
hazards in to the scene

241
00:11:53,748 --> 00:11:56,204
and we have an instance of our hazard

242
00:11:56,204 --> 00:11:58,657
these instances can hold a reference

243
00:11:58,657 --> 00:12:01,505
to our instance of the Game Controller.

244
00:12:02,497 --> 00:12:04,802
So we have to find our references

245
00:12:04,802 --> 00:12:07,848
to the Game Controller after the game has started.

246
00:12:08,762 --> 00:12:10,914
Each new hazard will have to find a new

247
00:12:10,914 --> 00:12:12,168
reference to Game Controller

248
00:12:12,168 --> 00:12:14,168
when they are instantiated.

249
00:12:15,607 --> 00:12:18,675
Open DestroyByContact for editing.

250
00:12:21,619 --> 00:12:25,000
Every hazard has an instance of this script

251
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,834
and every hazard will have to find

252
00:12:26,834 --> 00:12:28,338
their own reference to the Game

253
00:12:28,338 --> 00:12:30,338
Controller component on the Game

254
00:12:30,338 --> 00:12:31,823
Controller game object.

255
00:12:32,355 --> 00:12:35,485
Let's modify this script to do just that.

256
00:12:35,985 --> 00:12:39,451
In Start we first need to find

257
00:12:39,451 --> 00:12:41,451
the game object that holds

258
00:12:41,451 --> 00:12:43,451
our Game Controller script.

259
00:12:44,255 --> 00:12:46,255
Let's call this reference the

260
00:12:46,255 --> 00:12:48,255
gameControllerObject.

261
00:12:48,755 --> 00:12:51,250
We will set this reference by using

262
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:53,834
GameObject.FindWithTag

263
00:12:54,334 --> 00:12:56,911
and the tag we will look for is

264
00:12:56,911 --> 00:12:58,621
GameController.

265
00:12:58,621 --> 00:13:00,621
This will find the first game object in the

266
00:13:00,621 --> 00:13:03,499
scene that we have tagged as GameController

267
00:13:03,499 --> 00:13:05,251
and we have only one.

268
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:08,640
Remember we tagged our Game Controller object

269
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:11,602
with Game Controller when we created it.

270
00:13:12,576 --> 00:13:16,649
Next if we have successfully found the

271
00:13:16,649 --> 00:13:18,649
game controller object,

272
00:13:18,649 --> 00:13:21,410
and we check this by testing the reference

273
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:23,410
to the Game Controller object.

274
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:26,509
So if the Game Controller object

275
00:13:26,509 --> 00:13:28,509
is not null

276
00:13:28,509 --> 00:13:31,305
where null means nothing or empty

277
00:13:31,305 --> 00:13:33,305
essentially no reference,

278
00:13:33,805 --> 00:13:35,805
then we will set our Game Controller

279
00:13:35,805 --> 00:13:40,317
reference to the Game Controller component

280
00:13:40,317 --> 00:13:43,035
on the Game Controller object.

281
00:13:43,035 --> 00:13:45,357
We do this by searching the Game Controller

282
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:48,254
object and getting the component on it,

283
00:13:48,254 --> 00:13:50,558
with GetComponent.

284
00:13:50,558 --> 00:13:54,009
searching for the type of GameController.

285
00:13:55,324 --> 00:13:57,324
Note this syntax where

286
00:13:57,324 --> 00:14:00,105
Game Controller is in angle brackets

287
00:14:00,105 --> 00:14:02,105
followed by parenthesis.

288
00:14:03,641 --> 00:14:06,152
Technically this is all the code we need.

289
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:08,306
We are however going to write

290
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:10,306
an insurance policy.

291
00:14:10,972 --> 00:14:13,415
If, after all this work,

292
00:14:13,415 --> 00:14:15,415
our Game Controller reference is

293
00:14:15,415 --> 00:14:17,054
the same as null

294
00:14:17,554 --> 00:14:20,408
we will use Debug.Log

295
00:14:20,408 --> 00:14:23,876
to put "Cannot find 'GameController' script"

296
00:14:23,876 --> 00:14:25,876
in to the console.

297
00:14:26,569 --> 00:14:28,652
Note that we are using single quotes

298
00:14:28,652 --> 00:14:31,336
around GameController so the entire

299
00:14:31,336 --> 00:14:33,615
message is one string of text.

300
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:36,568
This is an insurance policy.

301
00:14:36,568 --> 00:14:39,539
With hope this line of code will never get called.

302
00:14:40,122 --> 00:14:42,219
If however something goes wrong

303
00:14:42,219 --> 00:14:44,536
and we accidentally break something

304
00:14:44,536 --> 00:14:47,691
and our game stops working or behaves badly

305
00:14:47,691 --> 00:14:50,455
with messages like these in our console

306
00:14:50,455 --> 00:14:52,455
we will have a place to start.

307
00:14:53,494 --> 00:14:56,328
Save this script and return to Unity.

308
00:14:56,906 --> 00:14:59,445
Let's setup our asteroid hazard.

309
00:15:01,008 --> 00:15:03,795
Select the Asteroid prefab game object

310
00:15:03,795 --> 00:15:06,268
and set the Score value to 10.

311
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:09,994
Below Score Value is the reference

312
00:15:09,994 --> 00:15:11,814
to Game Controller.

313
00:15:11,814 --> 00:15:14,234
We can't set this in the Inspector.

314
00:15:15,005 --> 00:15:17,187
If we cannot set this in the Inspector

315
00:15:17,187 --> 00:15:19,366
let's not see it in the Inspector.

316
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:22,791
Open DestroyByContact for editing.

317
00:15:23,582 --> 00:15:26,628
Change public to private

318
00:15:26,628 --> 00:15:28,628
on the Game Controller reference.

319
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:33,553
Save this script and return to Unity.

320
00:15:34,777 --> 00:15:36,957
Now we have no access to this property

321
00:15:36,957 --> 00:15:38,957
in the Inspector or from any other

322
00:15:38,957 --> 00:15:40,957
script, it is private.

323
00:15:41,927 --> 00:15:43,927
Let's setup our Game Controller.

324
00:15:44,427 --> 00:15:46,427
Select Game Controller.

325
00:15:46,817 --> 00:15:48,817
Take note of Score.

326
00:15:49,497 --> 00:15:51,497
Unlike the Game Controller reference on the

327
00:15:51,497 --> 00:15:55,035
Asteroid prefab we can set Score in the Inspector,

328
00:15:55,035 --> 00:15:56,745
we just don't want to.

329
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:00,002
Score is handled perfectly well in the script.

330
00:16:00,654 --> 00:16:02,806
This property is set by the script on the

331
00:16:02,806 --> 00:16:04,806
first frame of the game so let's

332
00:16:04,806 --> 00:16:07,487
set this one to private as well.

333
00:16:08,719 --> 00:16:10,995
Open the Game Controller for editing.

334
00:16:12,655 --> 00:16:16,203
Change score from public to private.

335
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:20,285
Save this script and return to Unity.

336
00:16:21,578 --> 00:16:23,578
We no longer see, not have access,

337
00:16:23,578 --> 00:16:25,578
to score.

338
00:16:25,578 --> 00:16:28,958
Let's set our reference to our Score display.

339
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,570
With GameController selected

340
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:34,411
drag the Score Text game object

341
00:16:34,411 --> 00:16:36,411
on to the Score Text property

342
00:16:36,411 --> 00:16:38,411
on the Game Controller component.

343
00:16:39,809 --> 00:16:42,099
Save the scene and enter Play mode.

344
00:16:52,696 --> 00:16:54,696
And now we score 10 points for each

345
00:16:54,696 --> 00:16:57,240
asteroid we destroy and the score is

346
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,240
displayed in the upper left.

347
00:16:59,974 --> 00:17:01,242
Fantastic.

348
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:06,089
Next, in the penultimate assignment,

349
00:17:06,089 --> 00:17:08,667
we will learn how to break out of our infinite loop

350
00:17:08,667 --> 00:17:10,150
and end the game.
