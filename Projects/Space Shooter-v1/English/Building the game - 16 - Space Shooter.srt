1
00:00:01,630 --> 00:00:03,375
Our game is complete.

2
00:00:03,375 --> 00:00:05,375
Let's build a web player and deploy

3
00:00:05,375 --> 00:00:07,375
that web player on to the web.

4
00:00:08,345 --> 00:00:10,345
Open the Build Settings window.

5
00:00:11,909 --> 00:00:14,775
The Build Settings has two main sections.

6
00:00:15,137 --> 00:00:17,556
The bottom part for setting the build target

7
00:00:17,556 --> 00:00:19,958
and customising details for the build

8
00:00:19,958 --> 00:00:21,958
and the upper part for selecting the

9
00:00:21,958 --> 00:00:23,958
scenes to build in to the game.

10
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:27,647
We do not need to include every scene in our

11
00:00:27,647 --> 00:00:29,647
project when we build our game.

12
00:00:30,271 --> 00:00:33,079
We only need to select the scenes we want.

13
00:00:33,579 --> 00:00:35,901
We can either drag the scenes we want

14
00:00:35,901 --> 00:00:37,901
from our Project view and drop them

15
00:00:37,901 --> 00:00:39,901
in to the upper window

16
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:43,177
or we can click the Add Current button

17
00:00:43,177 --> 00:00:45,177
to add the current open scene to the

18
00:00:45,177 --> 00:00:46,611
build window.

19
00:00:47,111 --> 00:00:49,626
As a side note, we can build a game

20
00:00:49,626 --> 00:00:52,711
with no scenes in the Scenes To Build window.

21
00:00:52,711 --> 00:00:55,439
If we do this Unity will temporarily use

22
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:57,866
the current open scene when building.

23
00:00:59,044 --> 00:01:01,320
Once we have selected the scenes to build

24
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,320
it is always good practice to check our

25
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:06,071
player settings before we actually build the game.

26
00:01:06,571 --> 00:01:08,780
For more information on player settings

27
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:11,319
please see the information linked below.

28
00:01:12,426 --> 00:01:14,661
When we are satisfied with our player settings

29
00:01:14,661 --> 00:01:16,661
we can return to the Build Settings window

30
00:01:16,661 --> 00:01:18,158
and choose Build.

31
00:01:18,658 --> 00:01:20,658
Unity will open a dialogue box

32
00:01:20,658 --> 00:01:22,658
prompting us for a name and location

33
00:01:22,658 --> 00:01:24,272
for our new build.

34
00:01:24,272 --> 00:01:26,272
I like to keep the builds associated with

35
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:29,637
the project, so let's create a new folder

36
00:01:29,637 --> 00:01:31,343
to hold our build.

37
00:01:31,343 --> 00:01:33,343
We will create this folder in the root of our

38
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:35,647
project along side the assets

39
00:01:35,647 --> 00:01:38,281
library and other default folders.

40
00:01:38,281 --> 00:01:40,281
It is important to note that this new folder

41
00:01:40,281 --> 00:01:42,281
should not be placed inside any of

42
00:01:42,281 --> 00:01:44,281
the default folders.

43
00:01:44,891 --> 00:01:46,533
Create a new folder in our project

44
00:01:46,533 --> 00:01:48,533
and call it Builds.

45
00:01:49,102 --> 00:01:50,566
Save the folder.

46
00:01:50,566 --> 00:01:52,677
With the Builds folder selected

47
00:01:52,677 --> 00:01:57,136
let's name our build Space_Shooter.

48
00:01:57,136 --> 00:01:59,385
We use the underscore here in the name

49
00:01:59,385 --> 00:02:01,385
as we will be deploying to the web

50
00:02:02,161 --> 00:02:03,924
and this name will be part of the web

51
00:02:03,924 --> 00:02:06,634
address or URL for the game.

52
00:02:06,634 --> 00:02:08,634
Spaces are not recommended in

53
00:02:08,634 --> 00:02:10,634
a web address or URL.

54
00:02:10,634 --> 00:02:13,370
So we should use an underscore, dash or

55
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:15,674
other web friendly character instead of

56
00:02:15,674 --> 00:02:18,543
spaces here when we are creating a web build.

57
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,418
It should be noted that we could,

58
00:02:21,418 --> 00:02:22,481
if we chose to,

59
00:02:22,481 --> 00:02:25,253
change the name of the HTML file to

60
00:02:25,253 --> 00:02:28,339
index.html if appropriate

61
00:02:28,339 --> 00:02:30,534
to shorten the length of the URL.

62
00:02:31,391 --> 00:02:34,476
When we have named our build select Save.

63
00:02:35,846 --> 00:02:38,467
Unity will now build our player.

64
00:02:43,208 --> 00:02:44,878
And when the build is done

65
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:47,155
Unity will open the target folder,

66
00:02:47,155 --> 00:02:49,321
in this case our Builds folder,

67
00:02:49,321 --> 00:02:51,321
revealing the built game.

68
00:02:52,249 --> 00:02:54,622
We have built a web player.

69
00:02:54,622 --> 00:02:56,553
Open the Space_Shooter folder.

70
00:02:57,053 --> 00:02:59,808
The web player comes in 2 parts.

71
00:02:59,808 --> 00:03:03,201
A Unity 3D file, which contains the data

72
00:03:03,201 --> 00:03:06,194
and an HTML file which describes the page

73
00:03:06,194 --> 00:03:08,669
that will play the game data in a window.

74
00:03:09,915 --> 00:03:12,505
If we look at the size of these 2 files

75
00:03:12,505 --> 00:03:14,784
we can see that the Unity 3D file is the

76
00:03:14,784 --> 00:03:18,152
larger of the 2 as it contains the game data.

77
00:03:19,191 --> 00:03:21,858
If we select and open the HTML file

78
00:03:21,858 --> 00:03:24,584
our operating system will load the HTML file

79
00:03:24,584 --> 00:03:26,584
in to our default browser.

80
00:03:30,869 --> 00:03:32,869
And the game will play in the web page.

81
00:03:34,696 --> 00:03:36,834
We are playing this game locally.

82
00:03:36,834 --> 00:03:38,834
To play this game globally we need to

83
00:03:38,834 --> 00:03:41,113
upload it to a web host of some sort.

84
00:03:41,903 --> 00:03:44,356
As an example I am going to upload this

85
00:03:44,356 --> 00:03:47,629
via an FTP client to an existing website.

86
00:03:48,612 --> 00:03:51,411
Open an FTP client, select a destination

87
00:03:51,411 --> 00:03:54,090
and upload both the HMTL and data files

88
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:55,783
into the same directory.

89
00:03:56,341 --> 00:03:58,975
In this case, for ease, I'm going to

90
00:03:58,975 --> 00:04:01,839
upload the entire folder containing both files.

91
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:10,224
When the files are uploaded open a browser

92
00:04:10,224 --> 00:04:13,211
and use the URL to open a new web page.

93
00:04:14,222 --> 00:04:15,958
The data will load from the web

94
00:04:15,958 --> 00:04:18,194
and we're playing the game globally.

95
00:04:18,194 --> 00:04:20,542
Anyone anywhere in the world with access 

96
00:04:20,542 --> 00:04:22,542
to the internet can play our game.

97
00:04:25,901 --> 00:04:27,901
Fantastic.

98
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:32,390
Thank you for taking these assignments,

99
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:34,390
following along and making this game.
