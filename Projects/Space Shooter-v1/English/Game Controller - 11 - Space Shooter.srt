1
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:03,384
We have a player ship, weapons

2
00:00:03,384 --> 00:00:05,454
and hazard objects.

3
00:00:05,454 --> 00:00:07,024
We need to bring them together in to a

4
00:00:07,024 --> 00:00:09,024
simple but playable game.

5
00:00:09,524 --> 00:00:11,441
To do this we need to create a 

6
00:00:11,441 --> 00:00:13,824
game controller to run our game,

7
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:15,435
to spawn our hazards,

8
00:00:15,435 --> 00:00:17,701
keep track of and display our score

9
00:00:17,701 --> 00:00:20,868
and when our player is destroyed end our game.

10
00:00:21,672 --> 00:00:24,202
First create a new game object

11
00:00:24,202 --> 00:00:26,202
to hold our game controller logic.

12
00:00:27,006 --> 00:00:30,049
Rename this game object Game Controller.

13
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:33,496
And then reset the transform.

14
00:00:34,105 --> 00:00:36,371
For this game object this step isn't

15
00:00:36,371 --> 00:00:39,435
absolutely necessary as this game object

16
00:00:39,435 --> 00:00:42,438
will not have a physical presence in our game.

17
00:00:42,438 --> 00:00:45,116
It won't have a collider and it won't be rendered.

18
00:00:45,492 --> 00:00:47,492
That being said it is always best

19
00:00:47,492 --> 00:00:50,431
to keep everything in our project neat and tidy

20
00:00:50,431 --> 00:00:52,431
and there is no good reason not to put

21
00:00:52,431 --> 00:00:55,201
the game controller cleanly at origin.

22
00:00:56,571 --> 00:00:58,930
Using the Tag drop-down menu in the header

23
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:01,784
of the Game Controller game object select the

24
00:01:01,784 --> 00:01:04,456
pre-made tag GameController.

25
00:01:06,093 --> 00:01:08,162
With our game object setup

26
00:01:08,162 --> 00:01:09,887
let's write our logic.

27
00:01:10,387 --> 00:01:12,387
With the Game Controller selected

28
00:01:12,387 --> 00:01:15,212
use the Add Component button

29
00:01:15,212 --> 00:01:18,057
to create a new script

30
00:01:18,057 --> 00:01:20,516
named GameController.

31
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:24,009
Accept the changes to add this new script

32
00:01:24,009 --> 00:01:25,748
to GameController.

33
00:01:26,386 --> 00:01:30,086
Select Assets and file the GameController script

34
00:01:30,086 --> 00:01:31,863
in the Scripts folder.

35
00:01:32,489 --> 00:01:34,489
Open the Scripts folder

36
00:01:34,489 --> 00:01:37,628
and open the GameController script for editing.

37
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:40,570
Our game controller will perform

38
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:42,268
several different tasks.

39
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:44,519
The primary task however will be 

40
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:46,810
spawning the hazards in our game.

41
00:01:47,364 --> 00:01:49,711
So the first thing we will need in this script

42
00:01:49,711 --> 00:01:54,383
is a public GameObject reference to our hazard.

43
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:57,712
Next we need to do something

44
00:01:57,712 --> 00:01:59,365
with these hazards. 

45
00:01:59,365 --> 00:02:02,414
We need to spawn them, preferably in waves

46
00:02:02,414 --> 00:02:04,181
for our player to fight through.

47
00:02:04,721 --> 00:02:06,721
Let's write a new function to spawn

48
00:02:06,721 --> 00:02:08,543
our waves of hazards.

49
00:02:08,543 --> 00:02:11,419
Write void SpawnWaves.

50
00:02:12,057 --> 00:02:14,717
Now we need to call this function.

51
00:02:15,217 --> 00:02:17,217
There are some functions that are called

52
00:02:17,217 --> 00:02:19,537
automatically by Unity

53
00:02:19,537 --> 00:02:21,923
but most of the functions that we write

54
00:02:21,923 --> 00:02:23,979
we will need to call ourselves

55
00:02:23,979 --> 00:02:25,673
or they won't be executed.

56
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:28,313
We want our SpawnWaves function to

57
00:02:28,313 --> 00:02:31,246
work for most of the duration of our game.

58
00:02:31,746 --> 00:02:35,353
So let's call SpawnWaves from start.

59
00:02:35,853 --> 00:02:38,799
So let's write void Start.

60
00:02:39,299 --> 00:02:42,235
Unity will call Start on the very first frame

61
00:02:42,235 --> 00:02:44,625
that this game object is enabled

62
00:02:44,625 --> 00:02:47,637
and then Start will call SpawnWaves.

63
00:02:49,491 --> 00:02:51,769
What do we want SpawnWaves to do?

64
00:02:51,769 --> 00:02:54,836
We want SpawnWaves to instantiate our hazards.

65
00:02:55,226 --> 00:02:59,240
We want to instantiate our hazards

66
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,475
at a spawnPosition

67
00:03:01,475 --> 00:03:04,124
with a spawnRotation applied.

68
00:03:05,826 --> 00:03:08,708
We have 3 parameters for instantiate

69
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:11,122
and we need a value for each of them.

70
00:03:11,122 --> 00:03:13,384
Let's look at each of these parameters

71
00:03:13,384 --> 00:03:15,176
1 parameter at a time.

72
00:03:15,552 --> 00:03:18,485
Our object Hazard has already been defined

73
00:03:18,485 --> 00:03:20,306
as a public variable.

74
00:03:20,888 --> 00:03:23,978
Our spawnPosition is a vector3 value

75
00:03:23,978 --> 00:03:28,268
so let's create a vector3 variable called 

76
00:03:28,268 --> 00:03:31,312
spawnPosition, which we will set to

77
00:03:31,312 --> 00:03:33,866
a new vector3.

78
00:03:35,678 --> 00:03:39,230
Our spawnRotation is a quaternion value.

79
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:41,938
So let's create a quaternion variable

80
00:03:41,938 --> 00:03:44,172
called spawnRotation

81
00:03:44,172 --> 00:03:48,183
which we will set to a new quaternion.

82
00:03:48,918 --> 00:03:51,665
Both of these will change before we're done.

83
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,193
Let's look at how we can assign

84
00:03:54,193 --> 00:03:56,193
working values to these.

85
00:03:57,024 --> 00:03:59,177
Hazard is a public variable.

86
00:03:59,177 --> 00:04:01,680
We can set this directly in the Inspector.

87
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:04,611
Save this script and return to Unity.

88
00:04:05,647 --> 00:04:07,647
We can see the hazard property

89
00:04:07,647 --> 00:04:09,881
on the GameController component.

90
00:04:10,382 --> 00:04:12,927
In the Prefabs folder we can find our

91
00:04:12,927 --> 00:04:14,927
Asteroid prefab.

92
00:04:14,927 --> 00:04:16,927
Drag the Asteroid prefab on to the

93
00:04:16,927 --> 00:04:19,425
Game Controller component and drop it

94
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:23,168
on to the Hazard slot to create the reference.

95
00:04:24,897 --> 00:04:27,229
We want to be able to set our spawn position

96
00:04:27,229 --> 00:04:29,229
in the Editor as well.

97
00:04:30,171 --> 00:04:32,672
Return to our GameController script.

98
00:04:34,494 --> 00:04:36,494
For our spawnPosition

99
00:04:36,494 --> 00:04:38,923
let's define a public vector3

100
00:04:38,923 --> 00:04:42,076
variable called spawnValues.

101
00:04:42,825 --> 00:04:45,446
Why can't we just use spawnPosition here?

102
00:04:45,946 --> 00:04:47,946
We will see why in just a moment.

103
00:04:47,946 --> 00:04:49,269
Patience.

104
00:04:49,269 --> 00:04:51,269
Save this script and let's set

105
00:04:51,269 --> 00:04:53,711
spawnValue in Unity.

106
00:04:55,648 --> 00:04:58,847
To help visualise this let's drag and asteroid

107
00:04:58,847 --> 00:05:01,390
prefab in to the scene temporarily.

108
00:05:02,815 --> 00:05:06,055
So on what position along the Y axis

109
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:08,055
do we want to spawn our hazards?

110
00:05:08,942 --> 00:05:11,850
On the X/Z plane or the game plane?

111
00:05:12,129 --> 00:05:14,655
So 0 on the Y axis.

112
00:05:15,402 --> 00:05:18,549
What about the position on the X/Z plane?

113
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:20,948
This could be better seen

114
00:05:20,948 --> 00:05:22,948
through the Game View camera.

115
00:05:24,442 --> 00:05:26,692
What position on the Z axis?

116
00:05:26,692 --> 00:05:28,692
Up, out of the game area.

117
00:05:29,565 --> 00:05:32,867
That looks like about 16.

118
00:05:33,464 --> 00:05:37,373
So let's set the spawnValue Z to 16.

119
00:05:40,704 --> 00:05:43,215
Now what about the X axis

120
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:47,284
Well we can't really use a single value here.

121
00:05:47,284 --> 00:05:49,284
If we did we will define a

122
00:05:49,284 --> 00:05:51,868
single point for our spawnPosition,

123
00:05:51,868 --> 00:05:53,868
and for that we could have used a simple

124
00:05:53,868 --> 00:05:56,397
game object's transform, like we did for

125
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:58,397
the shotSpawn on the player ship.

126
00:05:59,118 --> 00:06:01,688
What we really want here is a random

127
00:06:01,688 --> 00:06:03,743
point in the X axis.

128
00:06:03,743 --> 00:06:06,104
One that is a new random value for

129
00:06:06,104 --> 00:06:08,452
each new hazard we spawn.

130
00:06:09,129 --> 00:06:12,627
This is why we couldn't use spawnPosition directly.

131
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:15,210
Let's return to our script

132
00:06:17,036 --> 00:06:19,657
We will use our spawnValues to set

133
00:06:19,657 --> 00:06:21,923
a random spawnPosition.

134
00:06:22,986 --> 00:06:25,463
Our spawnPosition is made up of 

135
00:06:25,463 --> 00:06:27,922
X, Y and Z values.

136
00:06:28,312 --> 00:06:30,312
Working from back to front

137
00:06:30,812 --> 00:06:33,496
our spawnPosition Z will be our

138
00:06:33,496 --> 00:06:36,254
spawnValues Z, or outside the

139
00:06:36,254 --> 00:06:37,918
top of the game area.

140
00:06:38,418 --> 00:06:40,418
Our spawnPosition Y will be

141
00:06:40,418 --> 00:06:42,667
our spawnValue Y

142
00:06:42,667 --> 00:06:45,293
or 0 on the game plane.

143
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,300
Our spawnPosition X is the one

144
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,023
that's more tricky.

145
00:06:50,023 --> 00:06:52,411
We can't use a single value here.

146
00:06:52,911 --> 00:06:55,687
We will use our spawnValue X

147
00:06:55,687 --> 00:06:58,379
to control a random value.

148
00:07:00,012 --> 00:07:02,975
Let's search the documentation for random again

149
00:07:02,975 --> 00:07:05,555
so we can look at the Random class.

150
00:07:06,221 --> 00:07:08,221
In this case we want to look at

151
00:07:08,221 --> 00:07:10,082
Random.Range.

152
00:07:10,624 --> 00:07:14,158
We give Random.Range a min and a max value

153
00:07:14,158 --> 00:07:16,158
and randomRange will return

154
00:07:16,158 --> 00:07:19,525
a random value between those 2 values.

155
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:22,785
This means we can feed Random.Range

156
00:07:22,785 --> 00:07:26,200
with the values of the edges of our game area

157
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,483
and it will return a random value between them.

158
00:07:29,983 --> 00:07:33,699
Copy Random.Range and return to our script.

159
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:36,890
Paste Random.Range in to our code

160
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:39,666
and let's feed Random.Range with

161
00:07:39,666 --> 00:07:42,276
- spawnValues.x

162
00:07:42,276 --> 00:07:44,721
and spawnValues.x.

163
00:07:46,737 --> 00:07:49,844
Save this script and return to Unity.

164
00:07:51,518 --> 00:07:53,518
Where are the edges of our game?

165
00:07:54,999 --> 00:07:57,742
Let's move our asteroid along the X axis.


166
00:07:58,132 --> 00:08:02,691
And it looks like about -6 and 6.

167
00:08:03,343 --> 00:08:06,863
So spawnValues.x is 6.

168
00:08:08,275 --> 00:08:11,686
Lastly we need to set our spawnRotation.

169
00:08:12,752 --> 00:08:15,124
Back to our GameController script

170
00:08:15,124 --> 00:08:17,046
let's find out more about

171
00:08:17,046 --> 00:08:19,046
quaternion in the documentation.

172
00:08:20,029 --> 00:08:22,319
Quaternions are complex.

173
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,319
We almost never access or modify

174
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,319
a quaternion directly.

175
00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:28,555
There are many quaternion functions for us

176
00:08:28,555 --> 00:08:30,401
for us to use.

177
00:08:30,401 --> 00:08:32,332
We won't be using any of the quaternion

178
00:08:32,332 --> 00:08:34,957
functions exactly, but we will be looking at

179
00:08:34,957 --> 00:08:38,273
a quaternion property called Identity.

180
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:42,417
Quaternion.Identity corresponds with

181
00:08:42,417 --> 00:08:44,806
no rotation of the quaternion.

182
00:08:45,306 --> 00:08:47,306
We will instantiate our hazards with

183
00:08:47,306 --> 00:08:49,306
no rotation at all.

184
00:08:49,806 --> 00:08:51,806
Copy Quaternion.Identity

185
00:08:51,806 --> 00:08:53,806
and return to our script.

186
00:08:54,209 --> 00:08:57,561
Paste this in to our code so the line reads

187
00:08:57,557 --> 00:09:02,853
Quaternion spawnRotation = Quaternion.Identity.

188
00:09:03,629 --> 00:09:07,191
Save this script and return to Unity to test.

189
00:09:08,216 --> 00:09:10,508
Remove our temporary asteroid.

190
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:12,508
Save the scene and play.

191
00:09:13,077 --> 00:09:15,244
And we get a tumbling asteroid

192
00:09:15,244 --> 00:09:17,382
from a random point left to right

193
00:09:17,382 --> 00:09:19,382
starting outside of the game area

194
00:09:19,382 --> 00:09:21,799
and moving along the game plane.

195
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,329
Let's enter and exit Play mode a few times.

196
00:09:25,829 --> 00:09:28,244
We can see that our spawn points are random

197
00:09:28,244 --> 00:09:30,244
and each new asteroid is spawned

198
00:09:30,244 --> 00:09:32,244
at a new random location.

199
00:09:33,918 --> 00:09:36,098
In the next assignment we will instantiate

200
00:09:36,098 --> 00:09:39,363
waves of hazards to challenge our player with.
