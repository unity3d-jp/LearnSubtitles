1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,472
Navigating the Unity editor interface is easy. 

2
00:00:04,094 --> 00:00:07,378
The core of the interface consists of five main panels. 

3
00:00:07,753 --> 00:00:11,543
The Scene View, the Hierarchy, the Game View,

4
00:00:11,543 --> 00:00:15,186
the Project panel and the Inspector panel. 

5
00:00:15,781 --> 00:00:18,782
The Scene View is where you'll visually construct your game, 

6
00:00:18,782 --> 00:00:22,456
manipulating objects in 2D and 3D. 

7
00:00:24,406 --> 00:00:27,416
The Game View is where you will preview your game, 

8
00:00:27,416 --> 00:00:30,049
and this becomes active when you hit the play button, 

9
00:00:30,049 --> 00:00:33,724
allowing you to play test at any time inside the editor.

10
00:00:34,938 --> 00:00:38,974
The Hierarchy lists all objects in the scene in alphabetical order 

11
00:00:38,974 --> 00:00:42,516
and in hierarchical order in order to show parenting,

12
00:00:42,516 --> 00:00:44,519
a way of grouping objects.

13
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:47,237
The Project panel shows all assets that you are 

14
00:00:47,237 --> 00:00:49,176
currently working with, in one place.  

15
00:00:49,159 --> 00:00:52,448
Giving you quick access to everything you are building your game with 

16
00:00:52,448 --> 00:00:56,704
from scripts to textures, 3D models, video and audio.

17
00:00:57,299 --> 00:00:59,797
The Inspector is a context sensitive panel 

18
00:00:59,797 --> 00:01:02,055
that shows the properties of what ever object,

19
00:01:02,055 --> 00:01:04,965
asset or setting panel you've selected. 

20
00:01:05,157 --> 00:01:07,807
Click on something new and the Inspector immediately 

21
00:01:07,807 --> 00:01:09,807
switches to show properties of that thing. 

22
00:01:13,399 --> 00:01:16,519
The play controls allow you to play test the game, 

23
00:01:16,519 --> 00:01:22,613
pause and progress frame by frame for more detailed testing. 

24
00:01:25,185 --> 00:01:28,605
The tools in the top left allow you to navigate the Scene View

25
00:01:28,605 --> 00:01:31,149
and also manipulate objects visually. 

26
00:01:34,525 --> 00:01:38,786
There are also toggles to allow for switching between local and world space

27
00:01:38,786 --> 00:01:41,581
and centre or pivot point based rotation.

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,177
The Layers dropdown allows you to quickly 

29
00:01:50,177 --> 00:01:53,108
show and hide layers of content in your game.

30
00:01:55,646 --> 00:01:58,136
The Layout dropdown allows you to switch between

31
00:01:58,136 --> 00:02:01,865
differing layouts of the Unity interface. 

32
00:01:42,499 --> 00:01:46,859
In the top right of the interface are the layers and layout dropdowns. 

33
00:02:07,568 --> 00:02:09,769
This concludes the interface overview. 

34
00:02:09,769 --> 00:02:14,892
