1
00:00:00,781 --> 00:00:02,278
Game Objects are the items 

2
00:00:02,278 --> 00:00:04,675
that make up your Unity scenes

3
00:00:04,675 --> 00:00:07,589
Everything within a scene is considered a game object

4
00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:10,977
and these objects are made up of a number of components.

5
00:00:16,197 --> 00:00:19,013
Each has a necessary transform component

6
00:00:19,013 --> 00:00:22,724
that contains the position, rotation and scale of the game object.

7
00:00:23,485 --> 00:00:24,826
Components can be added

8
00:00:24,826 --> 00:00:26,441
using the Add Component button at

9
00:00:26,441 --> 00:00:27,942
the bottom of the inspector.

10
00:00:31,325 --> 00:00:34,985
Or by using the Component top menu.

11
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:41,978
Scripts are also considered as components

12
00:00:41,978 --> 00:00:45,180
and can be added using the aforementioned menus.

13
00:00:48,023 --> 00:00:50,171
They can also be created and added using the Add Component button.

14
00:00:59,408 --> 00:01:01,408
Components can be removed,

15
00:01:02,575 --> 00:01:06,035
or copy pasted using the cog icon to the right

16
00:01:06,035 --> 00:01:08,389
of their representation in the inspector.

17
00:01:11,623 --> 00:01:14,258
You can then select another object and paste them

18
00:01:14,258 --> 00:01:15,750
by clicking on the cog icon.

19
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:20,299
You can also add a script to an object

20
00:01:20,299 --> 00:01:22,062
by dragging it to the hierarchy

21
00:01:22,062 --> 00:01:24,062
or to the object in the scene view.

22
00:01:28,127 --> 00:01:31,505
And you can even drag and drop to empty space in the inspector

23
00:01:31,505 --> 00:01:33,860
in order to add a script as a component.

24
00:01:38,411 --> 00:01:41,869
Game objects are seen in the hierarchy view as a list,

25
00:01:43,952 --> 00:01:46,499
with a hierarchy of parent child relationships

26
00:01:46,499 --> 00:01:49,721
demonstrated by arrows to the left of their name.

27
00:01:52,718 --> 00:01:56,014
The Hierarchy is a list of all the game objects in the scene

28
00:01:56,014 --> 00:01:58,675
and as such everything that you see in the scene view

29
00:01:58,675 --> 00:02:00,675
is also listed in the hierarchy.

30
00:02:00,675 --> 00:02:03,385
And when selecting a game object in either view

31
00:02:03,385 --> 00:02:05,081
it's selected in both.
